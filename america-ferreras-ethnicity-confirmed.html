Along with Danielle Brooks for The Colour Purple and Da’Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers, Ferrera is one of three persons of color nominated for supporting actress. As Fererra has expressed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>:</p><p>“It feels great to see the range of women that are being acknowledged in the supporting actress category and so excited that Lily Gladstone was in the Best Actress category as well.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Ferrera has been a vocal advocate for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">possibilities and rights of people of color in Hollywood</a>. The 39-year-old actress has wanted to be an actress since she was nine years old. As she revealed in her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2019 TED Talk</a>, she never saw anyone who looked like her on television or in films. She continued,</p><p>“My family, friends, and teachers all constantly warned me&nbsp;that people like me didn’t make it in Hollywood.&nbsp;But I was an American.&nbsp;I had been taught to believe that anyone could achieve anything,&nbsp;regardless of the color of their skin,&nbsp;the fact that my parents immigrated from Honduras,&nbsp;and the fact that I had no money.”</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>Ferrera has made it a point to speak out about the difficulties she faces in Hollywood as a woman of color. Over the years, as she has battled to land a job “that wasn’t a poorly written stereotype,” Fernera has encountered the notion that her identity is a barrier she must get past. Years later nevertheless, Ferrera is now seen as an inspiration for all women who are perceived as “different.” So, what exactly is America Ferrera’s ethnicity?</p><h2 id=h-is-america-ferrera-latina data-injectable=false>Is America Ferrera Latina?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>America Ferrera was born in&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;on April 18, 1984, to Honduran parents who emigrated to the United States from Honduras in the mid-1970s. Her parents, América Griselda Ayes and Carlos Gregorio Ferrera were originally from&nbsp;Tegucigalpa, giving America Ferrera an indigenous Honduran descent. The actress herself revealed that she traces&nbsp;her ancestry to the Lencas.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The&nbsp;Lenca, also known as Lepa Wiran, meaning “Jaguar People” or “People of The Jaguar” are an Indigenous people from present-day southwest&nbsp;Honduras&nbsp;and eastern&nbsp;El Salvador&nbsp;in&nbsp;Central America. Ferrera’s father went back to Honduras after her parents divorced when she was seven years old. She was estranged from her father when he passed away there in 2010.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>But despite everything, Ferrera feels proud of her ethnicity and recently expressed her joy at being able to represent her community on a global stage, (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>)</p><p>“I’m so proud to get to bring Latiné representation to this year’s Academy Awards, along with my fellow Latiné nominees. May the diversity of voices acknowledged by the Academy continue to grow!”</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=false>The actress emphasized that it was encouraging to see that there were possibilities for women of color to shine and participate in the year’s top films this year. From her career-defining role as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ana in Real Women Have Curves, to Gloria in Barbie</a>, Ferrera has come a long way. Yet, she continues to be an inspiration for people who dream big, regardless of their age, ethnicity, or body type.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurrHRopqaZZaav7Ox0ZqqZp2knbuqr8itsGabn6Ozqr7Mnpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-get-the-emerald-axe-for-free-in-fortnite.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can You Get The 'Emerald Axe' for Free in Fortnite?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-edith-mack-hirsch-everything-to-know-about-her-age-family-boyfriend-career-networth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Edith Mack Hirsch?
