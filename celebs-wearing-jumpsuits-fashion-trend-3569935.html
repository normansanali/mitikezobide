The mother-of-one looked fabulous when she rocked a fitted pale pink <strong>C/Meo Collective Clean Slate Jumpsuit</strong> featuring long-sleeves, which she rolled up, straight-leg pants, and an elastic belt that cinched in her tiny waist. Down the entire front of the casual but sexy jumpsuit, was a chunky white zipper, which she kept zipped up all the way. She accessorized her cool outfit with a pair of Y<strong>eezy Boost 350 V2 Sneakers</strong> in Triple White and <strong>Victoria Beckham Flat Top Visor Sunglasses</strong>. We absolutely loved Eva’s outfit and she managed to make her casual ensemble look super chic and sexy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>Margot</strong><strong> Robbie</strong>, 28, stole the show at the Dreamland premiere during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tribeca Film Festival</a> in New York City on April 28. The blonde bombshell looked absolutely stunning in a completely sheer black lace <strong>Chanel</strong> jumpsuit which hugged her figure perfectly. The bodice of the one-piece featured buttons down the front, with a low-cut cleavage-baring neckline. Meanwhile, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her tiny waist </a>was cinched in with a black leather belt with a gold clasp, while the legs of the suit flared out into wide-legs. On top of her sexy lace jumpsuit, she donned a fuzzy black cardigan, which she left open, dressing down the look a bit. She topped her look off with a simple pair of satin black pointy-toed pumps. Aside from Margot, another one of our fave celebs who rocked a jumpsuit recently is <strong>Sofia Richie</strong>, 20. Sofia looked flawless when she headed to the ASOS Life is Beautiful party in Los Angeles on April 25 wearing a pale blue <strong>ASOS Design Tie Waist Linen Collar Jumpsuit</strong> which featured a baggy bodice with a v-neckline, which she chose to go braless under, a cinched in elastic waist, and skinny leg pants. She topped her look off with a pair of clear PVC ankle strap sandals and effortless beachy waves, making this red carpet look sexy, but also dressed down and relaxed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Some of our other favorite stars who have also proved that you can dress down the jumpsuit trend include celebs like <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, 38, and <strong>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</strong>, 31. Kim has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted wearing a jumpsuit</a> on multiple occasions recently. On March 6, Kim was in Paris when she chose to wear a completely sheer black cheetah print vintage <strong>Azzedine Alaia</strong> jumpsuit with just two little black pieces of fabric covering her private parts, topping her look off with a long black velvet duster coat and a pair of patent leather black pumps. Just one day before that, she opted for another vintage <strong>Azzedine Alaia</strong> printed jumpsuit, but this time it was a skin-tight tan leopard print one-piece which she wore with a matching patterned coat on top, and platform leopard booties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eva-longoria-pink-jumpsuit-mega-embed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/margot-robbie-sexy-jumpsuits-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rosie, on the other hand, has opted for more laid-back jumpsuit styles than Kim has. The gorgeous blonde model opted to wear a tan <strong>Ralph Lauren</strong> Judson Suede Jumpsuit back in February while in New York City. The one-piece featured a wrap-front bodice with a collar, while the waist was cinched in by a thin banded belt. The bottom half of the jumpsuit featured a zipper on the front of the skinny leg trousers, which highlighted Rosie’s lean legs, and she accessorized with <strong>Givenchy</strong> D-Frame Acetate and Gold-Tone Sunglasses, a gorgeous chunky <strong>Simon Teakle</strong> 18KT Gold Curb Link Necklace and <strong>Jimmy Choo</strong> Bronze Minny Leather Sandals. Most recently, Rosie donned a jumpsuit to the Patrick Ta Beauty Collection Launch on April 4, in LA. Her baggy pink <strong>Isabel Marant</strong> Tundra Denim Jumpsuit featured short sleeves, and a cinched in elastic waist. Instead of leaving the flared pant legs out, she tucked them into a pair of black <strong>Isabel Marant</strong> Ladra Leather Over-the-Knee Boots.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The jumpsuit trend doesn’t have to be fancy, which both <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>, 21, and <strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong>, 22, have proved. Kylie stepped out for lunch in LA on April 3, when she threw on a skin-tight, bright red cotton elastic jumpsuit with sneakers. The sleeveless onesie highlighted Kylie’s curvaceous figure and showed off insane cleavage in the low-cut scoop neckline. Kylie paired the bright outfit with a simple pair of white <strong>Adidas</strong> Falcon Sneakers and a small purse, making the trend super relatable to all of us, as it was casual, but chic. Meanwhile, Hailey has been spotted a few times in this look. One of our favorites was her tan corduroy painter’s uniform look that she wore around Paris on March 3, and her slinky spaghetti strap <strong>Zara</strong> Wrinkled Look Jumpsuit that she wore while on vacation with her new fiancee, <strong>Justin Bieber</strong>, 25.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>No matter what type of jumpsuit you wear this spring, these stars have proved that there’s a ton of different ways to style the one-piece outfit, whether it’s with accessories or shoes. The best part about the look is that it can be dressed up or down, making it the perfect transitional trend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Keo56ao2LEpq3RoqWgZZqqurG%2F1KKrrGWWlsCptc6nZK2qlaOxbn%2BUb3Bya2Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-le-blanc-quits-top-gear.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt LeBlanc quits Top Gear after 2 years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kross-asghedom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kross Asghedom: Family Member, Birthday, Net worth, Parents, Nationality</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
