"A lot of great and a lot of not-so-great all mixed together."</p><p>The Brown twins, who played football from a young age, did not know their dad (former Canadian League football player Darren Isaac) while growing up.</p><p>Chase and Sydney got an opportunity to play football for an elite private school in Florida, at which point Raechel admitted to a family the boys would live with near campus, "I said, 'I depend more on them than they depend on me.' That was the reason why it was so important for them to go and focus on themselves."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by CHASE BROWN (@chasebrown___)</a></p><p>Chase Brown during his high school years in Bradenton, Florida.</p></figure><p>“It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a> about saying goodbye to her sons in Florida and heading back to Canada. “It was totally unnatural, leaving your kids in another country with people you don’t know. I cried the whole way back.”</p><p>Raechel made huge sacrifices for her sons to play football in the United States, even losing her home for a second time so she could pay tuition to St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Bradenton.</p><p>“It was not something I really told them,” she admitted about experiencing homelessness while the boys were at school. “I just said they couldn’t come home.”</p><p>But the hard times have given way to a bright future for the so-called "mirror" twins, whose features mirror one another's.</p><p>“They’re so hardworking and so dedicated in everything they do,” their mom ultimately said. “They deserve this so much.
