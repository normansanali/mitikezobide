entire childhood.</p><p>Holm’s is the daughter of Tammy and Roger Holm, with her father being a preacher in Albuquerque and her mother working as a massage therapist.</p><p>Active in several sports, Holm excelled in swimming, gymnastics, and soccer, but found her true calling in combat sports while attending Manzano High School.</p><p>Following her high school graduation, Holm attended the University of New Mexico, but her amateur fighting career was starting to take off so she dropped out to focus on her training.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In January 2002, Holm made her professional boxing debut with a technical knockout, winning her first five career bouts.</p><p>Holm would have a couple of draws

MMA career, defeating Christina Domke via technical knockout.</p><p>Holm would go on to win her first nine matches, including her two initial Ultimate Fighting Championship matches against Raquel Pennington and Marion Reneau, earning the praises of <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/gina-carano-net-worth/ data-lasso-id=111639 data-wpel-link=internal>Gina Carano</a> and other female legends.</p><p>In November 2015, Holm pulled off a massive upset by defeating Ronda Rousey via knockout in the second round to win the UFC Women’s Bantamweight Championship.</p><p>Holm would, unfortunately, go on a cold stretch while training with <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/joanna-jedrzejczyk-net-worth/

data-wpel-link=internal>Ronda Rousey</a> as she was paid $165,000 in total, which included a $50,000 bonus for the best fight of the night and $40,000 from Reebok.</p><p>As champion, Holm earned a

divorce was said to be a rather amicable one, with neither party asking for alimony payments and not having children avoided any child support disagreements.</p><p>Holm has an <a href=# rel="noopener
