Although she wants a baby in the future, Young said she’s “not ready” for pregnancy right now.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have a lot of things coming up and a lot to prepare for,” the 34-year-old told the publication on April 22. “Already having two kids and balancing work and life and family – just everything. I just felt like my body’s not ready.”&nbsp;</p><p>Young said she wanted to go into pregnancy feeling “very excited, not stressed, not feeling overwhelmed,” and she is “just not at that place right now.” It makes sense that the reality star has been experiencing a lot of stress, considering she is working on multiple shows for Netflix and HGTV.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#><strong>‘Selling Sunset’ Star Heather Rae Young Hints at Having a Baby With Tarek El Moussa in Father’s Day Instagram Post</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmJqutbTEq2SrmZVixrDBzaBkoZmjYsGpsdKeZJ2do560r3nInZyaq12bvLN51KeZqKqeYsCwutJmpa6qo5q%2Funs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snoop-dogg-shares-touching-family-photo-after-his-mothers-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snoop Dogg Shares Touching Family Photo After His Mother's Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./saquon-barkley-signs-with-the-philadelphia-eagles-a-game-changer-for-the-team.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Saquon Barkley Signs with the Philadelphia Eagles: A Game-Changer for the Team</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
