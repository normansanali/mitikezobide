Us Weekly has gathered the many reality stars who have mingled with other reality stars and ended in a relationship.</p><p>Bravolebrities, for example, are no strangers to crossover hookups. In August 2019,<strong> Craig Conover, Shep Rose </strong>and<strong> Austen Kroll</strong> visited the cast of Summer House at their Hamptons home. During their visit, which aired on season 4 of Summer House, Conover cozied up to casemate <strong>Jules Daoud</strong>.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Hey, let’s do waterslide races,’ and they were like, ‘We’re in,’” Craig recalled on the “Daily Dish” podcast at the time. “<strong>Kyle [Cooke], Paige [DeSorbo]</strong>, myself, and Jules just stayed on the waterslide the whole time. And I think, as the day went on, Jules and I ended up kissing on top of the waterslide, I think. But they didn’t air any of this stuff.”</p><p>After a night of partying in the Hamptons, the Sewing Down South founder spent time with Daoud in New York City.</p><p>“I spent the summer in New York, so Jules and I hung out for a couple of weeks and then, whenever I was in New York, we hung out. We just had a great time and we’re still close friends,” he said at the time. “Jules and I are still really close. If I go to New York, we’ll probably hang out. But you know, nothing serious.”</p><p>Conover confirmed in November 2020 that things between him and Daoud were over for good as he started seeing girlfriend<strong> Natalie Hegnauer.</strong></p><p>“I’m dating someone new now. She was great, we had a lot of fun, but she actually just texted me that she was coming to Charleston,” Conover said on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “Unfortunately, I did not text her back, because I didn’t think that would be appropriate. I haven’t figured out how to navigate those waters yet.”</p><p>Daoud isn’t the only Summer House cast member to spend time with another Bravo star. <a href=#><strong>Carl Radke</strong></a> hooked up with Vanderpump Rules’<a href=#><strong> Scheana Shay</strong> </a>in 2018.</p><p>“We rounded third base,” she confessed to <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> on WWHL in 2019.</p><p>When asked why they didn’t go “further,” Radke added, “We just — you know, we weren’t ready yet.”</p><p>One year later, Shay was spotted cozying up to Southern Charm’s<strong>&nbsp;Rose</strong> at <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a>’s wedding, which was filmed for season 7 of the Bravo show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Shep and I hung out a couple times, but I never slept with him,” the “Good As Gold” singer told Bravo in May 2020. “Same with Carl; hung out a couple times, never slept with him. But they’re just fun guys who I met when I did Watch What Happens Live with Shep a couple years ago, and I was in a relationship, so we just had a great friendship. And then he did my podcast in L.A. and we hung out after, had too many drinks, and had a drunken makeout.”</p><p>Scroll through for more reality TV hookups:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BnsqK4yK2wZquklr%2B0edahpmackamypXnSrZirq12bv7C5jKiroZ2iYsCpu9asZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sava-schultz-biography-wikipedia-age-and-reddit-everything-to-know-about-tiktok-star.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sava Schultz Biography, Wikipedia, Age and Reddit Everything To Know About TikTok Star</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./noah-thompson-american-idol-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Noah Thompson American Idol Parents, Age, Wiki, Girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
