The musician from the San Francisco Bay area started out in the ’90s and it’s fair to say he’s had a pretty successful career making <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hip-hop</a> music and contributing to the hyphy movement which he created. The 45-year-old is most well known for his songs, “Superhyphy”, “That Go”, and more. A majority of his most well-known material is from the early 2000s.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Recently Keak met with fellow rapper YG and appeared on the artist’s Instagram. The pair are supposedly shooting a music video which was the reason for the meet-up, as YG also appeared on Keak’s Instagram. His appearance threw a few fans, who were surprised to see the musician in a wheelchair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtXNWjWuDQ6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==</figure><p>“Damn im late didnt kno bro was n a wheel chair now”</p><p>“Damn I didn’t know he was in a wheelchair”</p><p>“Omg 😳 I had no idea he was in a chair ..glad to see him tho”</p><h2 id=h-why-is-keak-in-a-wheelchair data-injectable=false>Why is Keak in a wheelchair?</h2><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>The musician has been wheelchair-bound for six years now; ever since 2017 in fact. During that year, Keak was the victim of a shooting on two separate occasions, with him being shot eight times during the second shooting. Miraculously he survived, but the attack left him requiring a wheelchair.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Keak revealed during an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DJVlad</a> that he was shot in the face, arms, and chest after he pulled into a gas station. His injuries left him unable to feel his legs, “when the bullets stopped I put the car in […] drive, I couldn’t feel my legs.” After he was taken to hospital the rapper fell into a three-day coma and has lost the use of his legs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>The musician revealed that he also required a colostomy bag and catheter when he spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KQED</a> regarding his prison sentence in 2019. He was sentenced to 16 months for possession of a firearm as a convicted felon.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>The rapper also revealed that he is undergoing rehabilitation, although the doctors have not been able to guarantee that he will walk again. However, there has been progress, “I can do a lot that I couldn’t do from that day.” To this day, it is still unknown who shot at the Californian rapper.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=false>His latest project with YG is a recent example of how he hasn’t let his injuries affect his love of rap and hip-hop. He also frequently attends events and social gatherings in the bay area, has released a couple of albums and EPs, and even went on a short tour. Despite his life-changing injuries, Keak Da Sneak still has a burning passion for music and continues his creative endeavors attracting fans both old and new.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZqOVlrhusMBmqqedkaB8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-brad-pitt-banned-himself-from-ever-getting-an-instagram-account.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Brad Pitt Banned Himself From Ever Getting An Instagram Account</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./weird-al-yankovic-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Weird Al Yankovic Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
