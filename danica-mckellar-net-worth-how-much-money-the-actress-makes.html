For more than three decades, she’s given her all in films, television series and philanthropic work with a well-earned <a href=#>net worth</a>. </span><b>Keep scrolling to see how much money the actress makes.&nbsp;</b></p><h2><b>What Is Danica McKellar’s Net Worth?</b></h2><p><span>Danica has an estimated net worth of $6 million, according to </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>. The California native shot to fame as a teen, scoring the role of Winnie Cooper on </span><i><span>The Wonder Years </span></i><span>in 1988. She appeared on the ABC series for all six of its seasons before it came to an end in 1993.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After making a few Lifetime film appearances and cameos on other television series, Danica landed a recurring role on </span><i><span>The West Wing</span></i><span> from 2002 to 2003. She also did some voice work in the animated show </span><i><span>Static Shock</span></i><span> from 2000 to 2004.

In October 2021, she announced she was leaving the network to join GAC Family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Part of it was because I had the opportunity to do a multi-picture deal, which I hadn’t done at Hallmark, and also not just multi-picture, but also really being a producer, really helping to develop these stories from the beginning,” the </span><i><span>Sidekicks </span></i><span>actress told </span><a href=#><i><span>Us Weekl</span></i><span>y</span></a><span> in July 2022 about her decision. “And that’s really exciting for me as a storyteller. I love that.”</span></p><p><span>Her first film on GAC Family,</span><i><span> The Winter Palace</span></i><span>, aired in January 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>How Else Does Danica McKellar Make Money Aside From Acting?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>On top of her acting work, the University of California graduate is a mathematics writer. Danica has written multiple books on the subject, aiming to inspire the next generation of students and make math fun. The </span><i><span>New York Times</span></i><span> bestselling author has always used math as a way to bond with her son, <a href=#>Draco</a>, whom she shares with her ex-husband, </span><b>Mike Verta</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“We’re working on some things. He knows his colors and his shapes. He still gets seven when he counts the toes on one foot — he really likes seven right now!” she told </span><i><span>People</span></i><span> back in 2012. “He likes it when I recite Pi. And I’m trying to teach him the quadratic formula, he hasn’t quite gotten it yet. It’s sung to the tune of ‘Pop Goes the Weasel.’”</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Domino Masters</span></i><span> judge married her second husband, attorney </span><a href=#><b>Scott Sveslosky</b></a><span>, in 2014. One thing Danica values above all is making memories with her hubby and her son.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I love inspiring people with my math books, I love providing quality entertainment with my Hallmark Channel movies — I love all that,” she told </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a><span> in April 2019. “But spending time with my little guy is just so precious. There’s no contest, and I’m really grateful.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dmKehk5Z6rq%2FKnqOlmaJiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrWww4ymrJygXaK8r7HYZquhnV2WsLW%2BxKyqZqWRoLK0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10-things-to-know-about-warriors-star-trayce-jackson-davis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 things to know about Warrior's Star Trayce Jackson-Davis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./when-did-t-j-lavin-start-hosting-the-challenge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>When did T.J.
