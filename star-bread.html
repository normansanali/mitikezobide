It needs to be warmed to about 110-120 degrees.</li><li><strong>Yeast</strong> — make sure your yeast is working by letting it proof with the warmed milk and some sugar.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — this helps the yeast to activate and also adds sweetness to the bread.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — use all-purpose or bread flour in this recipe.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — a flavor enhancer and integral ingredient in baking.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong> — use unsalted butter. If you only have salted butter, reduce the salt amount by 1/4 teaspoon.</li></ul><p><strong>Cinnamon Sugar Filling Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>Butter, Sugar, and Cinnamon (you can make your own cinnamon sugar mixture or buy from the grocery store)</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Star-Bread-11-720x727.jpg alt="This Star Bread is a pull-apart bread that is perfectly soft and fluffy and filled with your favorite fillings.

Let sit until it becomes foamy and begins to bubble. This should take about 5-10 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li>Add in melted butter, remaining sugar, and eggs. Add flour and salt. Mix at low speed until the dough begins to form a ball. I like to use my Bosch mixer for this recipe. Knead the dough in your mixer or by hand for 8-10 minutes.</li><li>Shape the dough into a ball and place in a bowl sprayed with non-stick cooking spray or oiled. Cover the bowl and let rise, until double in size, about 1-2 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cinnamon-Sugar-Star-Bread-Dough-rolled-into-a-circle-720x968.jpg alt="Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread Dough rolled into a circle" width=720 height=968 data-pin-description="Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread Dough rolled into a circle" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>After the dough has doubled, place it on a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. I suggest using a very sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut it into 4 pieces.</li><li>Roll each dough ball into a 12-inch circle. Place on a piece of parchment paper to make it easier to transfer to a baking sheet. Brush the first layer of dough with melted butter for the filling and then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Repeat.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cinnamon-Sugar-Star-Bread-Dough-cut-into-triangles-720x766.jpg alt="Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread Dough cut into triangles" width=720 height=766 data-pin-description="Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread Dough cut into triangles" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>Once you add your 4th circle to the top, brush with the remaining melted butter and any remaining cinnamon sugar, if you desire. Some people leave the top with butter only and some like to add cinnamon sugar on the top before baking.</li><li>Use a pizza cutter to trim the dough to create a uniform circle. Place a small round cookie cutter or glass (about 3-4 inches) in the center of the dough. Use a sharp knife and cut the circle into quarters. Then cut each quarter in half and then half again so you end up with 16 pieces.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Star-Bread-Dough-before-baking-720x757.jpg alt="Star Bread Dough before baking" width=720 height=757 data-pin-description="Star Bread Dough before baking" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>Grab two strips of dough next to one another, one piece in each hand, and twist the dough 3 times away from each other.

Make sure your milk is at an ideal temperature of 110-120 degrees. If it is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li><li><strong>Give it time to rise for the 1st time</strong>. This is the only long rise so the dough needs to at least double in size.</li><li><strong>Once you form it into a star shape, don’t let it rise again for too long</strong> or it will puff up too much and lose the star shape.</li><li><strong>Don’t overbake the star bread</strong>. Watch carefully.</li></ul><h3>Popular Bread Recipes:</h3><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=26592 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/star-bread/>Pin It</a><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Cinnamon Sugar Filling:</h4><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Cream Cheese Frosting (optional):</h4><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=23><li id=wprm-recipe-26615-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=3><p><span>In a mixing bowl, combine warm milk, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of sugar.
