Co-written and directed by Costner, it also stars Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Luke Wilson, and Thomas Haden Church. The movie, set to have three sequels, does not yet have a release date.</p><p><strong>“America’s expansion into the west was one that was fraught with peril and intrigue from the natural elements to the interactions with the indigenous peoples who lived on the land and the determination and at many times ruthlessness of those who sought to settle on it.”</strong></p><a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Kevin Costner" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Kevin Costner</a><p>The story unfolds over 15 years, during and after the expansion and settlement of the American West during the Civil War. <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Kevin Costner" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Kevin Costner</a>, who also serves as producer on the film, previously referred to&nbsp;Horizon&nbsp;as his passion project. He elaborated on its themes when the movie was first announced in January 2022.</p><p>“America’s expansion into the west was one that was fraught with peril and intrigue from the natural elements to the interactions with the indigenous peoples who lived on the land and the determination and at many times ruthlessness of those who sought to settle on it,” Kevin Costner said. He explained that Horizon sheds light on the varying perspectives and consequences of the characters’ decisions.</p><p>Kevin Costner initially created&nbsp;Horizon&nbsp;as a standalone film in 1988. After the release of his 2003 film&nbsp;Open Range, he decided to approach Walt <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Disney</a> Pictures with the project. But it wasn’t until 2022 that real progress had been made. Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema later came on board to help with distribution. Filming for the first installment began on August 29, 2022, in the southern regions of Utah.</p><p><strong>Kevin Costner’s <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> movie Horizon: An American Saga will be rated R.</strong></p><p>Horizon: An American&nbsp;boasts an extensive cast. Starring alongside Kevin Costner are Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Luke Wilson, and Thomas Haden Church are Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Giovanni Ribisi, Will Patton, Kathleen Quinlan, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Alejandro Edda, Tanka Means, Michael Rooker, and Ella Hunt.</p><p>Other actors appearing in the Kevin Costner movie are Jeff Fahey, Tom Payne, Wase Chief, Tim Guinee, Michael Angarano, Colin Cunningham, Scott Haze, Angus Macfadyen, and Douglas Smith. Jon Beavers, Owen Crow Shoe, Danny Huston, Larry Bagby, Dale Dickey, Hayes Costner, James Landry Hébert, Dalton Baker, Georgia MacPhail, Naomi Winders, and Austin Archer also star.</p><p>Earlier this year, it was reported that Kevin Costner was leaving&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone</a>&nbsp;after its fifth season, which subsequently marks the series’ final outing. Co-creator of the series, Taylor Sheridan, commented on Costner’s departure, expressing his hope that&nbsp;Horizon&nbsp;proves to be a success. “My view of Kevin as an actor remains unchanged. His portrayal of John Dutton is emblematic and commanding.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kevin-costner-yellowstone-rifle-900x506.jpg><p>“I’ve always been able to resolve any issues with Kevin [Costner] over the phone. However, once lawyers become involved, communication breaks down, false statements and attempts to shift blame based on public perception occur,” Sheridan added. “Kevin bore a significant burden, and I don’t believe anyone deserves that. His movie appears to be a high priority for him, and he wishes to redirect his focus. I genuinely hope that the movie lives up to expectations and proves to be outstanding.”</p><p><strong>Kevin Costner, who also serves as producer on the film, previously referred to&nbsp;Horizon&nbsp;as his passion project.</strong></p><p>Despite Kevin Costner’s departure,&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;continues to maintain its status as one of the most beloved series in the United States. The show delves into the challenges faced by the Dutton Family, who own Montana’s largest ranch. Since its debut in 2018, the series has received widespread acclaim for its gripping intrigue and the outstanding performances delivered by its cast.</p><p>Expanding on its remarkable success, the franchise has introduced two spin-offs,&nbsp;1883&nbsp;and&nbsp;1923, which explore the origins of the Dutton family’s ascent to power. The second part of&nbsp;Yellowstone’s&nbsp;fifth season has no release date as of yet.</p><p>In the absence of Kevin Costner, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Paramount data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Paramount</a> is redirecting its focus toward a new&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;series set to debut in December. While an official title has not been disclosed, there are hints that it will somehow incorporate the original show’s name. The plot and cast details are being kept under wraps, although previous reports have hinted at the potential involvement of Matthew McConaughey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ijlau2r3nCqKqtppWnwG60zqugs6eeYr%2BiwMinnmegpKK5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-de-bruyne-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-200726-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin De Bruyne Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-lawler-net-worth-how-rich-is-jerry-lawler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Lawler net worth: How rich is Jerry Lawler</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
