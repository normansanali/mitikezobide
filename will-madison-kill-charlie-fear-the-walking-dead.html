She starts out her time on the series as a pawn in infiltrating the Season 4 stadium camp when <a href=#>Madison</a> is its leader. Madison takes a liking to Charlie and wants to take her under her wing and for a little while, it seems like that will happen.</p><p>But Charlie, a spy for the outlier group called the Vultures, shoots and kills Madison's son Nick at the request of the Vultures' leader.</p><p>Flash forward a few seasons, and Charlie is as reformed as they come. She even fights by Alicia's side. Since Alicia is Nick's sister, that's really saying something. But now that Madison is set to return to the series, will she be so forgiving to someone who killed her son? Madison is thought to be dead in Season 4 and she never sees Nick get shot.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: AMC</span><p>Charlie from 'Fear the Walking Dead.'</p></figure><p>As far as Madison is concerned, Nick and Alicia are both alive and ready to welcome her with open arms. But when she finds out that Charlie, the child she tried to help save, actually killed her son, it's bound to cause trouble for everyone.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Madison is set to make her 'Fear the Walking Dead' return.</h2><p>In Season 4's mid-season finale, Madison seemingly sacrifices herself to save her group at the stadium when a horde of walkers gets in. She sets a fire to distract them and, in Madison's last moments on the show up until this point, she is seen being overtaken by the group of walkers.</p><p>Although some fans believed she died, others held out hope. And now, we know Madison is going to be in Season 7 of Fear the Walking Dead.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I feel like when madison comes back she’s going to be in a dark place so when she finds out nick died she’s gonna kill charlie <a href=#>#ftwd</a></p>— DonDada✨ (@40CalKxnn) <a href=#>March 30, 2022</a></figure><p>Showrunners Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> that Madison's return is going to be more than a one-off episode to show that she's still alive. Instead, according to them, she will be in several episodes.</p><p>Andrew told the outlet that "When she appears, it is going to be in a major, significant way" and it won't "just be a cameo."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Madison kill Charlie on 'Fear the Walking Dead'?</h2><p>In the same interview, Andrew described Madison as a "mother bear" and Ian alluded to Madison becoming a different person than she was when fans last saw her. If that's the case, then Madison could be much more hardened than before. And if she's different, and not as forgiving, then Charlie's life could be in danger.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I do not think Madison will kill charlie. Even if she found out about the nick thing before radiation takes Charlie out. <a href=#>#FearTWD</a></p>— ℭ (@CYBER_BIIOTH) <a href=#>April 25, 2022</a></figure><p>Then again, there's a good chance Charlie could die before Madison even reunites with her. After Ian confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> that "Charlie is very sick" from radiation poisoning, it caused some fans to speculate on Twitter that her death will come before Madison can even get her hands on her.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Madison is one of the only OG 'Fear the Walking Dead' characters left.</h2><p>When Madison appeared to be killed off Fear the Walking Dead, fans were collectively upset. Madison is like the Rick Grimes of this show. It seemed impossible that she would actually be killed off.</p><p>Besides Alicia, Daniel, and Strand, Madison is one of the few remaining original main characters on the show. And now that we know she's alive, things are about to shift in a major way.</p><p>Watch Fear the Walking Dead on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST on AMC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIymmJ2ho6S7brfIpaNmm5iWv621xGadnpmiYsGpsYywmKWjmaO0brDEmps%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1338635-mandy-rose-reflects-on-her-wwe-release-i-was-very-hurt-and-very-disappointed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mandy Rose Reflects On Her WWE Release: I Was Very Hurt And Very Disappointed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-brook-stated-that-she-has-no-desire-for-marriage-or-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Brook Stated That She Has No Desire For Marriage Or Children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
