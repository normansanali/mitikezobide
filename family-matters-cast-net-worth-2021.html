For two hours, families all over the country were entertained by shows like this one, “Step by Step,” “Dinosaurs,” “Boy Meets World,” and of course, “<a href=#>Full House.</a>”</p><p>Originally launched as a spin-off of the largely-forgotten “Perfect Strangers,” “Family Matters” launched the careers of rising <a href=#>young Black talents.</a> One of those talents was none other than Jaleel White, whose rise to fame as “Steve Urkel” (and, later, his counterpart “Stefan Urquelle”) follows him around almost to this day.</p><p>But believe it or not, the show may never have become <a href=#>the cultural touchstone</a> it is today if the producers had stuck to the original plan. White’s character was originally meant to be a one-off character, but when he stole the show in the first season, the producers shifted the focus.</p><p>“They kind of had to accept that I was there,” White said of the cast, <a href=#>to E! News.</a> “<a href=#>That was a process.</a>”</p><p>Eventually, though, the cast did accept him — and it wasn’t long before it became the top-rated show of the network. From 1989 until 1997, you couldn’t go anywhere without seeing the show. But let’s take a look at what the main cast of “Family Matters” is up to today.</p><p>Editorial Note: The net worths listed in this piece are speculative estimates drawn from a variety of online sources.</p><h3>Jaleel White</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jaleel-White_Bryan-Steffy.jpg><p><span><strong>Estimated Net Worth: $8 Million</strong></span></p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jaleel White has an estimated net worth of $8 million. Most of that money comes from his impressive&nbsp;“Family Matters” salary. But, most recently, <a href=#>AfroTech told you</a> about his investment in the cannabis industry with the Purple Urkle brand.</p><p>“The thing that always stood out to me was there no clear brand leader for fire purple weed,” said White in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes.</a>&nbsp;“It made no sense to me, that no company of significance had claimed this lane, so why not me?”</p><h3>Kellie Shanygne Williams</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kellie-Shanygne-Williams_-Rick-Kern.jpg><p><span><strong>Estimated Net Worth: $2 Million</strong></span></p><p><a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Kellie Shanygne Williams-Jackson — aka “Laura Winslow” — has an estimated net worth of $2 million.
