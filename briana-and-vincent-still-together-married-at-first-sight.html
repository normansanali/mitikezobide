They're still fan favorites and they're the only success story from their season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @blmyles</a></figure><p>If you had told <a href=#>Married at First Sight</a> fans at the start of Season 12 that <a href=#>Vincent</a> and <a href=#>Briana</a> would be the one couple to make it out of the season unscathed, they would have been surprised. The pair had some hiccups that sometimes made it seem like they might not work out in the end. So, are Briana and Vincent still together after MAFS?</p><p>Of the five <a href=#>couples</a> from Season 12, only three mutually opted to stay together on Decision Day. And after the show ended, just one couple remained married. That couple was Briana and Vincent. But now, two years after the season aired, where does the golden couple of Season 12 stand? A lot can happen in two years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @blmyles</a><p>Briana and Vincent recently welcomed a baby girl.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Briana and Vincent from 'Married at First Sight' still together?</h2><p>True love does exist in the realm of reality TV. At least, sometimes. Briana and Vincent left Season 12 of MAFS together and ready to take on their future. And now, in 2023, the couple is still going strong. In fact, they just welcomed their first child, a baby girl, together. You can't get more successful than that when it comes to being a MAFS couple.</p><p>On Jan. 18, Briana shared an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post announcing their daughter's arrival from Jan. 3 and wrote, "Our little lucky charm is finally here."</p><p>Prior to the arrival of their little girl, the couple shared their gender reveal on social media and allowed their fans to keep up with Briana's pregnancy progress every step of the way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Briana Myles (@blmyles)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Briana and Vincent join other 'MAFS' parents in the franchise.</h2><p>Fans who have followed Briana and Vincent since their season of MAFS are excited to see the couple still going strong and even starting a family together. But they aren't the only couple from the franchise to take such a big step and remain together well after filming.</p><p>Doug Hehner and Jamie Otis from all the way back in the first season are still together with two kids now.</p><p>Season 5's Ashley Petta and Anthony D'Amico also had a baby together and they were even featured in the short-lived spinoff Married at First Sight: Happily Ever After?

And for Briana and Vincent, it was no different. But outside of starting a family, they've kept busy in other ways too.</p><p>They started a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> channel together, on which they share updates on their life and travel videos. And, although Vincent was a car broker when he was on MAFS, he's now in real estate.</p><p>Plenty has changed for them since MAFS, but the one thing that's remained constant is their marriage and they really are proof that the MAFS experiment can work.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bqrc2aZJqmlGLDqrrCnqWtZaOptq24jK2moJ2knbKzecyaqauhlZl6osCMn6Crq6RiwKqzx60%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bridget-marquardt-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bridget Marquardt Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-rhymestyle-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All About Rhymestyle | Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
