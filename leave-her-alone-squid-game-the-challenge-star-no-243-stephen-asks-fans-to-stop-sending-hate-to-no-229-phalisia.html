Their father-son dynamic was light and infectious in a game that was fueled by high stress and emotional eliminations.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>But, Rick and Stephen’s demise was perhaps the hardest elimination fans had to stomach through the first batch of episodes.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>Phalisia had taken stock of the “Gganbu Gang,” an all-male alliance with Rick and Stephen at the helm, and she said in a confessional that she wanted to break up the group. “I’m a watcher,” Phalisia said in episode 4:</p><p>“Seeing all these male-dominant alliances form, it rubs me the wrong way. Being married to a woman, a strong woman, we deal with this every day. When I see this here, it pisses me off. This is not what we’re here for.”</p><p data-characters=44 data-current-count=44 data-injectable=false>Well, Phalisia got exactly what she wanted.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Later, she volunteered as one of five players to take part in a dormitory elimination test. After randomly selecting a jack-in-the-box, each contestant took their turn opening theirs to see what was inside — either instant elimination, the power to eliminate other players, or an advantage for the next challenge.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>An extremely emotional Phalisia was the last to turn the toy’s mechanism. But to her relief, she wasn’t booted from Squid Game: The Challenge. Instead, she was forced to crush the dreams of three others. First, she picked No. 130, the guy who snagged the advantage right before her turn.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Then, she turned her gun on the beloved duo. She called out Stephen’s number, and then Rick’s. Both men left the dormitory shocked that their game was over.</p><h2 id=h-stephen-and-other-squid-game-the-challenge-stars-defended-phalisia data-injectable=false>Stephen and other Squid Game: The Challenge stars defended Phalisia</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>Since then, Phalisia has been showered with hate from numerous viewers for her decision to eliminate the fan favorites.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>But, during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an online meetup</a> with members of his Gganbu Gang (Rick wasn’t there), Stephen reminded the Squid Game: The Challenge community that it was just a game, and No. 229 did what she thought was best for her individual game and her chance of winning $4.56 million.</p><p>“I’ve been hearing things about Phalisia. Stop being mean to Phalisia. If you’re in the comments, leave her alone and tell your friends to leave her alone. She made a good move. It just wasn’t a cool move — it was a good move.”</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=118 data-injectable=false>No. 204’s Dan also chimed in, calling it a “game move” and Phalisia a “super nice lady.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you what, and Marcus (No. 209) can attest to this. She came up to Marcus and she came up to me afterwards and she said, ‘Listen guys, I apologize. I know those were your boys.’ And we said, ‘Listen, it’s a game move. You did what you got to do.’ Now, we had our sights set on her later if we ever had a shot. But, she’s a super nice lady — you can’t be mad at her for that. You’re right, Steve, Get off her back, everyone.”</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>Several other contestants have come to Phalisia’s defense. Bee, player No. 018 who appeared on fans’ radars as a successful captain during Warship, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p><p>“You were so clearly stressed up there. I could see it. And then boom, you composed yourself and you took the shots you had to take. Didn’t miss a beat. There were no good choices, only logical choices.”</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>Dash, player No. 141 who was eliminated during the same dormitory test as Stephen and Rick, also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">took to the platform</a> to help simmer down the disgruntled viewers.</p><p>“INFURIATED with the racist hate & death threats towards @Phalisia2 & her beautiful family. She’s a TRUE friend with a HUGE heart. 229 is a BAD ASS unafraid to do what’s best for her game. Sending vile hate over a GAME MOVE is SICK. PLEASE do better.”</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Phalisia has remained active on X and has done her best to disengage with the hate. And in a Nov. 27 post, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">threw out the idea</a> of her, Stephen, and Rick getting together on a social media platform to hash things out. And if it does happen, expect both men to be accepting of her choice.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>Rick spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screen Rant</a> a few days back and although he was having difficulty getting over his unceremonious ousting, he said Phalisia had “every right” to eliminate them.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Regardless, Phalisia is still in the running for the seven-figure grand prize. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Episodes 6 through 9</a> are scheduled to release on Netflix on November 29, and the finale will follow a week later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytscCvnGaglad6orjOp5xmq6GqtqV5xpqknmWknbJur8eao6Wdnpyybr%2FTmqlmpp9if3V%2FjKyrnqiYmrturdKkqmaekaPAbsDOZqqtp6BiwKa6w6KloGWYlsGmedOoZKenXWd%2FennPoZiloaOernA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-young-net-worth-23.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Young Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-mom-mandy-teefeys-ups-and-downs-a-timeline.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selena Gomez, Mom Mandy Teefey's Ups and Downs: A Timeline</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
