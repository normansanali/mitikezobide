"And on the whole, that worked."</p><p id=esKTeqiSIh data-wc=13>The Principal also emphasized the importance of privacy of information to all students.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Prince William and Kate take a trip down memory lane at St Andrews</figure><p id=eIAH59VyIJw data-wc=36>"One thing that I did as soon as we knew that William was going to be a student, was to warn the student body that we expected them to respect privacy of information," Dr Lang said.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-E5w2I2JNf data-wc=49>"So, I made it quite clear to the students by doing an interview to the student newspaper, in which I made it quite clear that we would take a very, very dim view of any inappropriate information being passed on. Not just about William, but about any other student.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_k3sjhsw5- data-wc=58>"This was not just a privacy issue for William, but for his fellow students as well. The privacy warning and the privacy injunctions were applied to the whole student body. We needed to take care of the privacy of all of the students, all of the staff, as well as William, and again on the whole that worked."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d8319c524e0c-prince-william-posing-in-halls.jpg><p id=epTPo08pd3h data-wc=35>Dr Lang continued: "After William had gone, a newspaper editor told me that he was astonished by just how disciplined and how secure the student body had been during William's time. They behaved extremely well.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3zo8iu2lZH data-wc=24>"I think that says a great deal for the student body and staff of St Andrews that nothing inappropriate, nothing significant, was passed on."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">A royal education</h4><p id=eHvOAgyKcsh data-wc=26>Rumour has it that students were offered – "not by UK newspapers but by overseas newspapers," Dr Lang said – £3,000 for a story about William.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSFJUX3sXG0S data-wc=39>"Now that's a lot for an undergraduate," the Principal said. "The story also is that none of these offers were accepted.

But somewhere in Scotland, slightly further away from the limelight that is much harder to get to… It's located almost out on a limb.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePj-XY1JeKDY data-wc=28>"I think in choosing a smaller university like that, they had a greater chance of enjoying a student experience like everyone else.
