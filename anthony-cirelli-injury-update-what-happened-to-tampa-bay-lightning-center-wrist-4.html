Anthony is a professional ice hockey center from Canada who now plays for the National Hockey League’s Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL).</span></p><p><span>He was taken in the third round (72nd overall) of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft by the Lightning. Cirelli led the Lightning to back-to-back Stanley Cup victories in 2020 and 2021.</span></p><p><span>Cirelli was recalled from the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League by the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 1, 2018.

In April, Cirelli did not play versus Florida. Cirelli could have simply been taking a day off, but it’s unknown whether he was also suffering from an ailment.</span></p><p><span>In May’s 2-1 win over Toronto in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference First Round series, he had four blocks and three hits.</span></p><p><span>Cirelli isn’t concerned with scoring in the postseason, as he has only one goal in seven games. He is, nevertheless, a Selke-worthy performer whose worth is determined by the weight of the wet blanket he lays on the opponent’s best player.</span></p><p><span>The NHL centre, 24 years old and in his sixth season in the NHL, is earning a reputation for his defensive abilities. He came in fifth place in the voting for the Frank J. Selke Trophy, granted to the forward who succeeds the most in the game’s defensive aspects.</span></p><p><span>Also Read:&nbsp;</span><span>Corey Perry Injury Update: What Happened Tampa Bay Lightning Player Face?</span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-tampa-bay-lightning-center-wrist><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-tampa-bay-lightning-center-wrist></span> What Happened To Tampa Bay Lightning Center Wrist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Cirelli missed the playoffs due to a wrist injury and will have surgery in the offseason for the 2020-21 season. However, there is no confirmed information on what caused the wrist damage in the first place.</span></p><p><span>He was reasonably productive in the playoffs, finishing with six points in his final eight games despite a five-game scoreless drought in Rounds 2 and 3. Cirelli did, however, take a dramatic step back in 2020-21, scoring just 22 points in 50 games after scoring 44 in 68 the previous season.</span></p><p><span>Despite tying Brandon Hagel for the team lead in 5v5 scoring chances with 21 in the series, he was held scoreless for the final four games of the Eastern Conference final.</span></p><p><span>His usage makes him a wonderful player to back, as he is one of only two Bolts forwards averaging more than 20 minutes per game in the playoffs.</span></p><p><span>Also Read:&nbsp;</span><span>What Is Wrong With Corey Perry Eyes?
