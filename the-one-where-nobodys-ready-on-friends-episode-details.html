Behind the scenes, things weren't the greatest for Matt LeBlanc, who sustained a very real shoulder injury. However, in front of the camera, fans adored the episode and it became one of the true favorites of the series.</p><p>As we'll reveal, the simplicity of the episode all took place because of a small budget.

As it turns out, he dislocated his shoulder during this very episode. The moment can be spotted by fans, as it takes place when Joey is battling it out for a spot on the couch with Chandler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>LeBlanc recalls the painful experience</a>, which lots of fans didn't even notice.</p><p>"We both look at each other, look at the chair, and neither one of us is sitting in it. So we both race to the chair, and I have to just step over the coffee table and land on this big, huge comfortable chair."</p><p>LeBlanc continues, "I don't even think it qualifies as a stunt. Somehow I ended up completely upside down, and I was going to land on my head between the table and the chair, so I put my arm up to break my fall and just exploded my shoulder."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Warner Bros Threatened To Fire Two Of The Main Cast Members On Friends During Renegotiations</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The injury was written into the show, with Joey apparently jumping and falling off the bed...</p><p>Although the episode was forgettable for the actor, it became an iconic one for the fans.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-no-one-s-ready-became-an-iconic-episode-despite-the-fact-that-the-show-had-a-limited-budget-for-it>The One Where No One's Ready Became An Iconic Episode, Despite The Fact That The Show Had A Limited Budget For It</h2><p>The episode aired back on September 26th in 1996.
