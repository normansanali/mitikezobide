What we’re really doing with the show is marrying history and fantasy in what I think is a very exciting way. One approach that we took to that is our approach to race.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I took this one possible fact which was that Queen Charlotte was England’s first Queen of mixed race, and I think that’s something that a lot of historians believe there’s evidence for."</p><figure>Queen Charlotte is played by Golda Rosheuvel. <span class=attribution>Picture: Netflix</span></figure><p class=paragraph-text>"And the idea really resonated with me, and it made me wonder - what could that have really looked like? What could have happened? Could she have elevated other people of colour in society and granted them titles and lands and dukedoms?

You also feel it with the tone of the show, things move fast in this world, people talk fast, the banter is really sharp and witty, and it’s funny. There’s a lot of humour to things. And it’s also really sexy, which you don’t always get with your traditional period shows.</p><p class=paragraph-text><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=#><strong>Bridgerton's Regé-Jean Page unrecognisable in throwback pics with his band</strong></a></p><p class=paragraph-text>"The look of the show is also very modern and feeling in terms of things being bright and vibrant and fresh. There’s a little bit of sparkle with everything, and I think that’s true with everything from our set design to our costumes, which are all rooted in the Regency time period, but the volume is turned up on everything.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Then of course there are the themes that we explore on the show, which are modern relatable issues.
