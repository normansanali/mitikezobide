Their breakup the following year jump-started a series of whirlwind romances for Farrell.</p><p>After being linked to <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></a> in 2003 and 2004, respectively, the Banshees of Inisherin star was rumored to have romanced his Alexander costar <a href=#><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></a>.</p><p>Farrell’s dating life, however, took somewhat of a backseat when his son James was <a href=#>diagnosed with Angelman syndrome</a> when he was only 1 years old. The Thirteen Lives star shares James, who was born in 2003, with his ex-girlfriend <strong>Kim Bordenave </strong>and <a href=#>he’s never been far from the thespian’s mind</a>.</p><p>“No, he’s much better than I am or was,” Farrell said during a February 2008 appearance on <a href=#>the Today show</a> when asked if he sees any of himself in his then 4-year-old son. “He’s just perfect to be honest. I really hope if he’s anything of me he’s whatever the best of me is. But, I have time to destroy him still!”</p><p>The <a href=#>Artemis Fowl actor’s love life</a> was once again in the news when he and then-girlfriend <strong>Alicja Bachleda-Curuś</strong> welcomed their son, Henry, in fall 2009. The pair called it quits in 2010, but Farrell remained committed to his role as a parent.</p><p>“It can be a terrifying thing — but also there’s a great liberation in being a father, if I can speak from a point of self-interest for a second. Because for the first time in your life you are not the most important thing in your world,” the Triage executive producer told <a href=#>E! News</a> in June 2015. “For the first time in your life you really have an understanding of what it is to love unconditionally. And it’s a pretty extraordinary gift.”</p><p>The <a href=#>father of two</a> added: “I enjoy my boys. They’re fun. They’re good dudes. I have two very lovely, lovely human beings that look to me for help and assistance. Can you imagine? They’re doomed.”</p><p>One year later, <a href=#>the Oscar nominee</a> was linked to a new woman, who was later identified as U2’s <strong>The Edge</strong> (real name David Howell Evans)’s personal assistant, <strong>Kelly McNamara</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My girlfriend, she travels a lot as well with work so oftentimes we’re two ships passing in the night,” <a href=#>Farrell told <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong> in 2017</a>, not revealing her name. “But we make sure to find a port that we can, you know, rendezvous at.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Farrell’s complete dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLC4yKdkn5mip7KtuNJmm5qsmaO0brTIrKuoqqlivam706iqZqyYp7y2s8dmq6GdXa6yor7SaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2021-emery-kelly-age-height-facts-about-the-singer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emery Kelly Age, Height &amp;amp; Facts About The Singer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-mccandless.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris McCandless Hiked Into The Alaskan Wild And Never Reemerged</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
