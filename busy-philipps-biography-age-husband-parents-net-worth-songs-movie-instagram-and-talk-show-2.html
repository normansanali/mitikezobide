Her first professional acting job was playing a real-life Barbie doll for a Mattel convention. She attended Loyola Marymount University, where her boyfriend was fellow actor Colin Hanks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age></span>Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elizabeth Jean Philipps was born on 25 June 1979, Oak Park, Illinois, United States. she is 40 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family></span>Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=parents></span>Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Philipps’ parents are Barbara and Joe Philipps</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=siblings></span>Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She has an older sister named Leigh Ann Philipps. Her mother introduced Philipps and her sister to the world of cake decorating; Philipps is now a cake artist who has made creative narrative cakes, stand-up cakes and more.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=philipps-husband></span>Philipps Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Philipps&nbsp;is married to Marc Silverstein in the year 2007. She&nbsp;married screenwriter Marc Silverstein in 2007. He’s written movies such as Never Been Kissed&nbsp;(1999),&nbsp;He’s Just Not That Into You&nbsp;(2009) — in which Philipps appeared — and&nbsp;2012’s&nbsp;The Vow (Philipps told ABC News that some of the weddings vows in that film came from her own ceremony with Silverstein). Silverstein also co-wrote and co-directed&nbsp;I Feel Pretty.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kids></span>Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Philipps has two daughters with Silverstein: Birdie Leigh (born August 13, 2008) and Cricket Pearl (born July 3, 2013). Both girls have appeared in her social media posts, though Philipps has said she tries not to embarrass them. As she noted in a 2017 interview, “I just really want to be respectful of the fact that they’re their own people, they have their own lives, and they didn’t choose to be my kids.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=body-measurements></span>Body Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Height: </strong>1.68m / 5 Feet 6 Inches</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>61kg / 135lbs</li><li><strong>Shoe Size: </strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Body Shape</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Hair Colour:</strong> Blonde</li><li><strong>Eye Colour:</strong> Green</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=salary></span>Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Details about Busy’s salary are not yet disclosed. However, information about how much she makes will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Philipps&nbsp;is an American actress who has a&nbsp;net worth&nbsp;of $12 million dollars</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=movies-and-tv-show></span>Movies and TV Show<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Often portraying characters with a wild streak, Philipps has been seen on numerous TV series. And in addition to working in movies as an actor, she has a story credit on&nbsp;Blades of Glory&nbsp;(2007), a film in which&nbsp;Will Ferrell and Jon Heder become pairs figure skating duo.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=%e2%80%98dawsons-creek></span>‘Dawson’s Creek’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2001 Philipps joined teen primetime soap&nbsp;Dawson’s Creek&nbsp;in the show’s fifth season. Her lively character of Audrey helped Joey (played by Katie Holmes) become a little less strait-laced, and became romantically involved with Pacey (played by Joshua Jackson).</p><p>Dawson’s Creek was also where Philipps met&nbsp;Michelle Williams, who played Jen on the show. Though their characters didn’t interact a lot onscreen, offscreen the two actresses started what’s become a lasting friendship.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=%e2%80%98freaks-and-geeks></span>‘Freaks and Geeks’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At the age of 19, Philipps was cast on&nbsp;Freaks and Geeks&nbsp;(1999-2000), her first TV show. Despite its short run, the production was a career launchpad for&nbsp;Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, Linda Cardellini, and Philipps.</p><p>Philipps played Kim Kelly, who was involved with&nbsp;James Franco’s character, Daniel. Though they had to make out for the cameras, the two actors didn’t get along in real life; in one incident, Franco shoved Philipps. However, they’ve since mended fences and become friends.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=%e2%80%98cougar-town></span>‘Cougar Town’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On TV’s&nbsp;Cougar Town&nbsp;(2009-15), Philipps played Laurie, a friend of star&nbsp;Courteney Cox’s character, Jules. Philipps directed an episode of the show during its final season.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=%e2%80%98white-chicks></span>‘White Chicks’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The movie&nbsp;White Chicks&nbsp;(2004) featured Philipps as one of the socialites deceived by&nbsp;Marlon Wayans&nbsp;and Shawn Wayans in their undercover disguises as the titular white chicks.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=%e2%80%98i-feel-pretty></span>‘I Feel Pretty’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the film&nbsp;I Feel Pretty&nbsp;(2018), Philipps plays Jane, one of star&nbsp;Amy Schumer‘s best friends. The film has Schumer’s character, who’s previously felt unattractive, suffer a blow to the head that makes her believe she’s stunningly beautiful — a storyline that received criticism for ostensibly conveying the message that some women could only embrace their appearance after suffering a head injury. Philipps spoke out against the backlash to the film, saying in an interview, “It was never about making fun of someone’s body or someone’s looks,” but rather intended to address common issues with self-esteem.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-roles></span>Other Roles<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>she was Gale Liptrapp on HBO’s Vice Principals and Dr. Hope Bobeck on ER. Among the TV shows she’s guest-starred on are How I Met Your Mother, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and New Girl. She’s also filled in as a host on Live with Kelly and Ryan, and has appeared on Drunk History.</p><p>The movies Philipps has acted in a range from romantic comedies like Made of Honor&nbsp;(2008) to the thriller&nbsp;The Gift&nbsp;(2015).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=instagram-success></span>Instagram Success<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Philipps has one million followers on the social media site Instagram; about 200,000 people view her Instagram Stories — short videos that disappear from the site after 24 hours unless Philipps saves them — every day. The stories she’s shared include intense trampoline workouts, the pain of leaving her daughter’s teddy bears behind while on vacation, an unsettling Uber ride, adventures with lifelong best friend Michelle Williams and returning from the Golden Globes only to find she was locked out of her house.</p><p>Thanks to her Stories, an editor at Simon & Schuster asked Philipps to produce a book of humorous autobiographical essays (arriving in the fall of 2018). And in the spring of 2018, Philipps landed a deal for a nighttime talk show on the&nbsp;E!&nbsp;network, which will contain segments that further explore her popular Instagram Stories. Tabloids and gossip magazines also often report on things Philipps has shared via Instagram.</p><p>In 2017 Philipps told Cosmopolitan, “I’m weirdly stopped more on the street now for my Instagram than any acting I’ve done over the last five years.” Social media success has also been lucrative; she made more money in 2016 from sponsored content — while noting she only works with brands she truly likes — than from acting</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=health></span>Health<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>she has been open about suffering from anxiety and occasional depression and has explained that exercise helps her manage these symptoms. After the birth of her first daughter, she suffered from postpartum anxiety, though it took a year for her to seek treatment. In 2018 she talked to TODAY Parents about how she’d felt at the time, sharing, “I didn’t even know that what I was going through was a thing. I just thought, ‘This is who I am, and I’m crazy.’”</p><p>Philipps has also discussed other health issues on social media, like the time she sunburned her eyes (photokeratitis) and when she had to go to the hospital due to a medical condition called ovarian torsion, which causes pain in the abdomen.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-phillips></span>Frequently Asked Questions About Phillips<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-phillips></span>Who is Phillips?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Busy is one of American best-known and lovedactress.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-busy></span>How old is Busy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Phillips is 40 years old as of 2019.
