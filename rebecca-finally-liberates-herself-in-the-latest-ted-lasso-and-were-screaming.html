However, by the time the credits roll in this week‚Äôs episode, Rebecca seemingly emerges as a woman unburdened.</p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>To recap, a hesitant Rebecca attends a summit to discuss the possibility of establishing the Akufo League, and finds herself the lone woman in a room with nothing but old and ludicrously wealthy white men, all of whom own some of the most prestigious football clubs around Europe. Edwin delivers his obnoxious one-percenter pitch. In response, heeding words of wisdom from Keeley that arrived in the nick of time via text message, Rebecca pictures the room for what it is ‚Äì a room of men who were all at one point or another, little boys ‚Äì who are in dire need of a privilege check.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>season 3 of <a href=#>#TedLasso</a> is simply Rebecca yelling at the men in her life for acting like a bunch of numpties and I wholeheartedly approve <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/D6VYej8UOC</a></p>‚Äî alyssa ‚≠êÔ∏è (spoilers) (@theolasso) <a href=#>May 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>She also finds herself appealing to Rupert‚Äôs childhood love of football, which he responds well to. Edwin, however, shrugs her off almost immediately, but Rebecca is seemingly met with agreement from all of her fellow club owners, prompting the eccentric billionaire to storm out of the room in a huff, but not before throwing a tantrum and covering his guests with food.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>REBECCA WELTON.

Then, in a brilliant callback to early days of season 1, she spits her tea all over him.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jason Sudeikis I could kiss you on the mouth (respectfully) for this scene only. <a href=#>#TedLasso</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tyqO4N5LJf</a></p>‚Äî üåªHello, Rebecca üíú|Ted Lasso Spoilers (@TedLassoisaVibe) <a href=#>May 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Needless to say, we‚Äôre so thrilled by this full circle moment for Rebecca, having been rooting for her to find her inner peace for so long now.
