Subsequently, after a thorough investigation, a suspect was apprehended in August 2015.</p><p>Bullock elogised her sister in an interview saying; “She lived as herself, she taught me how to be (myself). She taught me how to take care of the family… She was happy with being who she was. She wasn’t worried about how others felt about her. A person that can isolate the whole world out and not care about other people’s feelings is a strong person, to me. That was one of the biggest things that I got from her.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Who is Reggie Bullock?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Bullock’s real name is Reginald Ryedell Bullock.

During the 2010 championship game against West Caldwell, Bullock’s exceptional performance earned him the title of Most Valuable Player, as he contributed a team-high 15 points. His consistent excellence on the court led to his inclusion in the AP All-State men’s team for three consecutive seasons, thanks to his impressive average of 25 points and 11 rebounds per game during the 2009-2010 season.</p><p>In January 2008, Bullock made the decision to attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, following a scholarship offer from the Tar Heels. Despite receiving offers from other prestigious institutions such as Maryland, Ohio State, Wake Forest, and Indiana, Bullock’s commitment to the Tar Heels remained unwavering.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The culmination of Bullock’s collegiate career came in 2013 when he was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers as the 25th overall pick in the NBA draft.

Bullock’s debut in the league took place on October 29, 2013, as he made his first appearance for the Clippers against the Los Angeles Lakers, contributing two points to his team’s efforts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>What happened to Reggie Bullock?</strong></h2><p>The San Antonio Spurs have reached an agreement to waive Reggie Bullock, thereby granting him free agency.
