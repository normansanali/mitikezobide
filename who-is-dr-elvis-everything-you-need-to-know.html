Early in 2020, while the coronavirus decimated nations and brought the world to a standstill, Francois emerged as a ray of hope. He recently moved judge Ken Jeong to tears with his performance of John Legend’s song Imagine.</strong></p><p>The 18th November episode of The Masked Singer was unquestionably the most dramatic one yet. The voice behind the snake suit, Dr. Elvis, emerged from his serpent’s skin. Ken started crying as he expressed his gratitude for Dr. Elvis’ work during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Dr_Elvis_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family>Where was Dr. Elvis born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family</span></h2><p>Born in <strong>1985</strong>, Dr. Elvis Francois spent his formative years in Miami and New York. Elvis developed a passion for medicine as a result of family vacations to their birthplace Haiti.</p><p>He was inspired to become a doctor after observing the happiness in the eyes of Haitians who received medical guidance. Elvis told the Associated Press, “Since then, maybe when I was 7 or 8, I’ve always looked at that as being something that I’d want to give the rest of my life to.”</p><p>Francois sang in the choir at church and high school, but he never thought music would make a good career. But he discovered that singing allowed him to connect with the patients.</p><p>He started utilizing music in <strong>2018</strong> to interact with his social media followers. Dr. Elvis developed a respectable fan base as a result of his singing, but it was his March cover of John Legend’s Imagine that catapulted him to international fame. He stated:</p><p>“When my dad received a call from a relative in France who had seen the video, I was like, ‘Oh wow!</p><p>It had only been a few hours. A little amount of good can impact people across the world, as seen by the notes I regularly receive from nurses in Italy, residents, and patients.</p><p>Elvis first became aware of his fame when People named him one of the sexiest men alive. He admitted to the magazine that, when he first entered medicine, he couldn’t have imagined such a future.</p><h2><span id=Dr_Elvis8217_first_EP_Music_is_Medicine8217s_earnings>Dr. Elvis’ first EP Music is Medicine’s earnings</span></h2><p>The COVID-19 relief operations will get all of Dr. Elvis’ first EP Music is Medicine’s earnings.</p><p>Jake Basden and Allison Jones worked together to arrange for Dr. Elvis to enter a recording studio so that he could record a project once he achieved international fame in late <strong>March 2020</strong>.</p><p>A four-song EP with the title Music is Medicine was the outcome, and it was issued by Doctor Elvis Records. The EP’s earnings, according to Dr. Elvis, will support COVID-19 relief efforts. Elvis discussed the effects of music on medicine with the Associated Press:</p><p>“This period in our life has been so special for all of us. Simply said, I consider it an honor to be able to share some music with others, especially in these challenging times. Although the work we do as surgeons and doctors has a significant impact, music has the power to move people in a way that medicine cannot.</p><p>The next chance for Dr. Elvis to become a household name came from a request to perform with the masked singers. Although he had always enjoyed the program, he had never imagined that he would get the opportunity to appear in it.</p><p>However, Dr. Elvis donned his recognizable but cumbersome and uncomfortably large serpent outfit and took the stage. The best moment of Ken Jeong’s time on the show was when he cried at Dr. Elvis’s disclosure. Entertainment Weekly quoted Dr. Elvis as saying:</p><p>“I would want to thank Ken. Even though I’ve only seen him on Unmasked, I’ve never seen him in person. However, I found it amazing to know that his comments to me were addressed to all of the medical professionals in the nation, and I believe that is where the genuine honor lies.</p><h2><span id=Is_Dr_Elvis_Single_Relationship>Is Dr. Elvis Single? Relationship</span></h2><p>Because of his dedication to surgery and medicine, He is unmarried.</p><p>Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Dr. Elvis’ marital status. He has been secretive about his dating life for the past few years, but during a recent interview on On Air With Ryan Seacrest, he revealed why he is single: he is married to medicine. Doctor Elvis stated:</p><p>“I’m not dating. I don’t have a lot of time because I pretty much live at the hospital. I’m a loner. I suppose I am married to medicine.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Has Shaun Robinson Got Remarried</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Doctor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Elliot P.
