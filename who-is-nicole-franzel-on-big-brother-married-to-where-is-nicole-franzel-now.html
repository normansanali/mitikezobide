Following that season’s All-Star edition reentering the house only further solidified Nicole as an icon within “Big Brother”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Where is Nicole Franzel Now?</h3><p>Post her “Big Brother” fame, Nicole Franzel has embraced a life that combines the joys of family with the lingering spotlight of her reality TV success.
