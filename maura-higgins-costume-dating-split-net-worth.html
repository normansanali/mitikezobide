Maura’s absolutely devastated, it appears the Strictly curse has struck again. Pals are hoping that they can patch things up. But only time will tell whether they’ll work things out as Giovanni is so busy.”</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>“He’s been focusing on Strictly, training his celeb partner Rose 24/7, and they’ve become really good friends. He's even been learning sign language from Rose, showing it off on social media.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Maura’s decided to take a step back and let him concentrate on the show.”</span></strong></p><p><span>Her boyfriend recently broke his silence on the split rumors saying, <strong>“Great relationships with great people can come to a natural end. This has been the case for me recently. There was absolutely no wrongdoing and this should be the end of any speculation.”</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Maura Higgins</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Irish media personality and model Maura Higgins has an <a href=# rel=noopener>estimated net worth</a> of $1 million.
