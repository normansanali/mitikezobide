But in the absence of humans, all kinds of wildlife have thrived. To mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War armistice, Google has released rare images of the DMZ’s wildlife, ranging from mountain goats to black bears.</p><p>“After the Korean War, the DMZ had minimal human interference for over 70 years, and the damaged nature recovered on its own,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Google Arts and Culture</a> explained. “As a result, it built up a new ecosystem not seen around the cities and has become a sanctuary for wildlife.”</p><p>Animals found in the DMZ include cranes, deer, trout, wildcats, and more. According to Google Arts and Culture, the zone contains 6,168 species, including 38 percent of Korean species that are considered endangered.</p><p>One of those species is the rare Asiatic black bear, which was captured on camera in the DMZ after eluding observers for twenty years. Another is the endangered musk deer, which lacks horns but has fangs in its upper jaw.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-425695 alt="Musk Deer In The DMZ" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/musk-deer-dmz.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-425695 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Institute of Ecology / Google Arts & Culture</span><span class=caption-body>The endangered musk deer calls the Korean DMZ home.</span></p><p>The creatures have been thriving in the buffer zone between South and North Korea, which includes habitats ranging from grassy moors and river gorges to rocky mountains and tidal swamps. Though fences and land mines keep most people away, animals have flourished in the DMZ’s lush landscape since the Korean War ended in 1953.</p><p>“Have you wondered what the Han River, which now cuts through the heart of Seoul, might have looked like in its natural state 100 years ago?” Seo Jae-chul, an expert adviser at Green Korea United, said, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>London’s Natural History Museum</a>. “You can see it at the DMZ, through the natural river banks and streams that are there.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-425709 alt="Korean Wildcat At Night" width=900 height=573 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/korean-wildcat-at-night.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-425709 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Institute of Ecology / Google Arts & Culture</span><span class=caption-body>A wildcat in the Korean DMZ caught on a night-vision camera.</span></p><p>The DMZ was created in 1953 at the close of the Korean War, which significantly ended with an armistice and not a peace deal. That means that the war between North and South Korea is technically still ongoing, and the DMZ acts as a buffer zone between the two countries.</p><p>The demilitarized zone covers an area about twice the size of New York City, as the Natural History Museum notes. But though animals are thriving within the zone, conservation efforts have been hindered by the enduring tension between the two countries.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC</a> reports, North and South Korea engaged in peace talks in 2018 that ecologists hoped would lead to a sharing of conservation responsibilities, and South Korea even opened a number of “peace trails” along the southern border of the DMZ in 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-425681 alt="Yellow Throated Marten" width=900 height=489 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/yellow-throated-marten.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-425681 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Institute of Ecology / Google Arts & Culture</span><span class=caption-body>Many of the new wildlife photos released by Google were taken by unmanned cameras. Here, a yellow-throated marten darts past a camera.</span></p><p>But peace talks between the two nations have since fallen apart. Tensions between North and South Korea have been especially high in recent months, as North Korea engaged in a record-high number of weapons demonstrations in 2022, a trend continuing into this year.</p><p>In that way, the DMZ represents two opposing ideas at once. On the one hand, it represents the death and destruction of the Korean War, which continues to cast a large shadow over North and South Korean societies today. But on the other, the DMZ represents life and has allowed dozens of rare species to thrive outside of humanity’s reach.</p><p>“The DMZ region represents a sad history for the two Koreas,” Kim Seung-ho, the head of DMZ Ecology Research Institute, noted. “But it has been a rare haven for the many wildlife living there.”</p><p>After reading about the wildlife that’s thrived in the Korean DMZ, see what these <a href=#>North Korean propaganda posters</a> say about Americans. Or, look through these heartbreaking <a href=#>photos from the Korean War.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonysu9GemKdllKLHbsPIpZuloZaa</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nvidia-gsync-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>NVIDIA G-Sync Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga-pays-tribute-tony-bennett.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga pays tribute to Tony Bennett WSOC TV</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
