The show has always been beloved because of its fashionable young stars living fancy lifestyles in Charleston, South Carolina. But while there was just as much drama as before, with <a href=#>Madison LeCroy and Olivia Flowers feuding</a> and the end of Madison and Austen Kroll's romance still hanging over the friend group's heads, there was something missing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While season 8 included arguments, juicy conversations between exes, and plenty of parties, it just didn't have the same fun feeling as previous seasons, and it was hard for many viewers to feel entertained. Add in the fact that <a href=#>Kathryn Dennis is leaving Southern Charm</a> and it's easy to wonder what will happen to the show next. Many fans felt that season 8 of Southern Charm was lackluster.</p><h2 id=fans-didn-39-t-like-paige-being-part-of-season-8-of-southern-charm>Fans Didn't Like Paige Being Part Of Season 8 Of Southern Charm</h2><p>Paige DeSorbo started her relationship with Southern Charm star Craig Conover in 2021. While <a href=#>Paige and Craig's relationship complicated Summer House</a>, the Bravo series she has become famous for starring on, their romance has made Southern Charm tough to watch for some. It's always tough when someone new joins an already-established series with fan-favorite cast members, but fans didn't love watching the scenes of this couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Paige-DeSorbo-And-Craig-Conover.jpg><p>Some of the most dramatic parts of season 8 included Craig and Naomie talking about how they bumped into each other while on a trip to Las Vegas and they ended up sleeping together. While Craig was clear that he didn't want to get back together and that he was happy with Paige, fans wondered if Craig and Naomie still had romantic feelings for one another, given the history that they shared and how serious they used to be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is The House In Southern Charm And Where Is It Located?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the couple seemed sweet together in some episodes, Craig was honest and raw about how Naomie would make fun of him for sewing. While he felt that she saw it as a goofy hobby that would never amount to anything, he now runs his company called Sewing Down South and seems to be really happy that he's living his dream. In season 8, it was awkward to watch scenes between the former pair, whether they chatted briefly at parties or met for coffee because Naomie wanted to talk about her drama with Kathryn.</p><p>However, the general feeling is that Paige was wrong to tell Craig to not spend any time with Naomie. One fan posted in a Reddit thread about season 8 of the reality series and wrote, "Am I the only one that finds Paige unbearable on Southern Charm??"</p><p>Several fans replied that Paige is envious of Craig and Naomie Olindo's past relationship. One fan wrote, "She’s too insecure to tell Craig she’s still jealous about him and N hooking up." Another posted, "I don’t like her jealousy." It seems like viewers would have been happier if Paige wasn't on season 8 at all or if the series didn't focus on Craig and Naomie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-southern-charm-have-any-interesting-storylines-left>Does Southern Charm Have Any Interesting Storylines Left?</h2><p>The early days of Southern Charm featured storylines that can be considered fascinating, engaging, and entertaining. In season 1, the love story began Kathryn Dennis and Thomas Ravenel began, as they flirted at parties and Kathryn revealed that she was pregnant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Southern-Charm-Cast.jpg><p>Over the next few seasons, the drama between the couple heated up, as they broke up and got back together many times and entered a difficult custody battle over their two children. However, viewers noticed a drop in the quality of plotlines by season 8, which just didn't hit the same juicy notes as before and sometimes even seemed like a different show altogether as it just didn't feel as fun to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-truth-about-madison-lecroy-and-her-fiance-s-combined-net-worth-and-what-they-do-with-all-their-money.jpg><p>Kathryn's season 8 plotline is all about her unhappy relationship with Chleb Ravenell and while she had tension with a few cast members, it was clear that she wasn't playing as big a role on the series as she once had, and fans definitely noticed. A fan posted on Reddit and wrote, "Kathryn really did carry this show in its glory days, and the only storyline we have left is the Craig-Naomie tension."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Southern Charm's Shep Rose Live A Life Of Insane Luxury Like His Impressive Net Worth Suggests?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan wondered if the reality series will continue and shared that they don't think that the last few seasons were high quality: "Do we think this is gonna be the last southern charm?! It was my favorite bravo show and the past few years tanked hard."</p><h2 id=the-shep-and-taylor-southern-charm-episodes-were-tough-to-watch>The Shep And Taylor Southern Charm Episodes Were Tough To Watch</h2><p>Fans also have a problem with the relationship between Shep Rose and Taylor Ann Green, and the problems between the couple were explored in season 8 of Southern Charm. For several seasons, viewers watched Shep dating around and sharing that he never wanted to get married or start a family. Then he said that he loved Taylor and wanted to be with her, but they continued to have issues.</p><p>Taylor shared that she wanted to get married and have children, and while Shep often said that he wasn't ready, viewers felt that he was being unfair to Taylor and making her think that they would take these steps in the future. By the end of the season, the tension between them was tough to ignore, as she was upset that he didn't want to make a real commitment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shep-Rose-Southern-Charm-Featured-Image.jpg><p>A fan shared on Reddit that they didn't like watching this play out on the series: "Starting with him leading Taylor on and not respecting that she wanted kids, and now him calling her an idiot and seeing no issue with it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is How Whitney Sudler-Smith From Southern Charm Is So Unbelievably Rich</a></span></p><p>After watching Shep date casually for several seasons, it was nice to see him in a serious relationship, and it was tough to watch him and Taylor be on different pages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple broke up in July 2022 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor thought she could reunite with Shep</a>. She explained at Bravo-Con in October 2022, “I always had that thought in my head that maybe if he was working on himself and doing things that we would have a conversation [about] ending up back together. But that’s not the case, so we’re good. I wish him well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXai8tsDHnqmnZZOdrrO5jKycmqufo3p5ecGam2aqkam2r7PSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./these-celebs-are-turning-55-this-year.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These Celebs Are Turning 55 This Year</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wwe-shawn-michaels-compares-rhea-ripley-to-chyna.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shawn Michaels Compares Rhea Ripley To Chyna</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
