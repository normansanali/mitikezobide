The 25-year-old woman reportedly went missing on July 13 after leaving work at a business at The Summit in Birmingham. When cops arrived at the scene, they were able to only recover her wig, cell phone, and purse that were lying on the roadway near her car.</p><p>Even though a probe was launched to find her immediately, Carlee surprisingly returned home two days later on July 15. Hoover (AL) Police Department said, "During the initial portion of the investigation, detectives were able to retrace nearly all of Carlee’s steps until the point she went missing and are confident that will continue to be the case," in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Judge recommends one year in jail for Carlee Russell, accused of faking her own kidnapping, but Internet isn't convinced</a></p><h2 class=split>'She was literally fighting for her life'</h2><p>Carlee’s boyfriend, Thomar Simmons, also issued a statement, saying, "I don’t even know how to start off this post but to only say thank you to my lord & savior Jesus Christ for saving my girlfriend’s life!" before noting, "All I asked from everyone right now is to be respectful of Carlee’s situation." "She was literally fighting for her life for 48 hours, so until she’s physically & mentally stable again she is not able to give any updates or whereabouts of her kidnapper at this very moment," Simmons added. But many people online began claiming that Carlee was not kidnapped, posting comments like "story seems fishy" and "This is completely fabricated."</p><h2 class=split>Who are Carlee Russell's parents?</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Carlee Russell's confused ex: Thomar Latrell Simmons still puzzled over ex-girlfriend's abduction hoax</a></p><p>Talitha Robinson-Russell and Carlos Russell are the parents of Carlee Russell, who have reportedly backed their daughter’s abduction claim. Her mother said, "I just didn't know people could be so evil," as per<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> NBC New</a>s. Talitha also took to Facebook to defend her daughter, writing, "We do want to ask for privacy at this time to allow us to just love on our daughter and each other with our close family and friends. Also, please consider the fact we have not slept for 3 nights and we are mentally and physically exhausted."</p><p>"Just as we made a commitment to not entertain negative thoughts during the time our daughter was missing, we surely will not entertain negative thoughts/statements, unvalidated opinions, or sheer ignorance at such a joyous time. We pray that those that doubt God's power, miracles, and the power of faith will be encouraged to draw closer to Him and learn the power of positive affirmations and unwavering faith," the mother added. Besides, as per Carlee’s father Carlos, his daughter is now suffering from "bad dreams" and "moments where some things make her cringe, afraid."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Where is Carlee Russell being held?
