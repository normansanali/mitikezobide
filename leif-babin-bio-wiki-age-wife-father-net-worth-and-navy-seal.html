Even when others doubt and question the amount of risk, asking, “Is it worth it?” the leader must believe in the greater cause. If a leader does not believe, he or she will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win.”</li><li>“As a leader, my default setting should be aggressive — proactive rather than reactive.”</li><li>“Ask questions until you understand why so you can believe in what you are doing and you can pass that information down the chain to your team with confidence, so they can get out and execute the mission.”</li></ul><ul><li>“Combat is reflective of life, only amplified and intensified.”</li><li>“Discipline — strict order, regimen, and control — might appear to be the opposite of total freedom — the power to act, speak, or think without any restrictions. But, in fact, discipline is the pathway to freedom.”</li><li>“Discipline equals freedom.”</li></ul><ul><li>“Discipline in such a situation started with the little things: high-and-tight haircuts, a clean shave everyday, and uniforms maintained. With that, the more important things fell into place: body armor and helmets worn outdoors at all times, and weapons cleaned and ready for use at a moment’s notice. Discipline created vigilance and operational readiness, which translated to high performance and success on the battlefield.”</li><li>“Discipline starts every day when the first alarm clock goes off in the morning. The moment the alarm goes off is the first test; it sets the tone for the rest of the day. The test is not a complex one: when the alarm goes off, do you get up out of bed, or do you lie there in comfort and fall back to sleep? If you have the discipline to get out of bed, you win — you pass the test. If you are mentally weak for that moment, and you let that weakness keep you in bed, you fail. Though it seems small, that weakness translates to more significant decisions. But if you exercise discipline, that too translates to more substantial elements of your life.”</li><li>Complete ownership of what went wrong. That is what a leader does — even if it means getting fired. If anyone was to be blamed and fired for what happened, let it be me.”</li></ul><ul><li>“If frontline troops are unclear about the plan and yet are too intimidated to ask questions, the team’s ability to effectively execute the plan radically decreases.”</li><li>“If you allow the status quo to persist, you can’t expect to improve performance, and you can’t expect to win.”</li><li>“If you don’t understand or believe in the decisions coming down from your leadership, it is up to you to ask questions until you understand how and why these decisions are being made.”</li></ul><ul><li>“If your boss isn’t making a decision in a timely manner or providing the necessary support for you and your team, don’t blame the boss. First, blame yourself. Examine what you can do to better convey the critical information for decisions to be made and support allocated.”</li><li>“In chaotic, dynamic, and rapidly changing environments, leaders at all levels must be empowered to make decisions. Decentralized Command is a key component to victory.”</li><li>“It is essential to develop a standardized planning process.”</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=leif-babin-book></span><span>Leif Babin Book</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win – 2015</li><li>The Dichotomy of Leadership – 2018</li><li>La Dicotomía Del Liderazgo (the Dichotomy of Leadership): Cómo Balancear Los Desafíos de Extreme</li><li>Ownership (Posesión Extrema) Para Liderar Y Ganar (Balancing the Challenges of Extreme Ownership to Lead and Win)- 2020</li><li>The Dichotomy of Leadership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin: Key Takeaways, Summary & Analysis Included – 2018<br><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-leif-babin></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About <strong>Leif Babin</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-leif-babin></span><span>Who is <strong>Leif Babin</strong>?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leif Babin is a famous former U.S. Navy SEAL officer, co-author of #1 New York Times bestseller Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win as well as the co-founder of Echelon Front, where he works as President/Chief Operating Officer, leadership instructor, speaker as well as a strategic advisor.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-leif-babin></span><span>How old is <strong>Leif Babin</strong>?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Babin was born in Woodville, Texas, United States, he has not shared his date of birth with the public, as it is not documented anywhere as of 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-leif-babin></span><span>How tall is <strong>Leif Babin</strong>?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Babin stands at an average height, he has not shared his height with the public.
