And now, 20 years later, her two sons are opening up about losing their mother at such young ages.</p><p>Harry, 32, previously <a href=#>revealed he recently had counseling to cope with his mother’s passing</a>. “Losing my mom at the age of 12 and shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years has had quite a serious effect on not only my personal life but also my work as well,” the red-headed royal said. Luckily today, Harry shares he’s in “a good place” after years of trying to forget about Diana’s untimely death.</p><p><a href=#>MUST SEE: Check out This Very Rare Portrait of Princess Diana Featured on a Magazine Cover!</a></p><p>However, he confessed he <a href=#>suffered panic attacks</a> at the time of her passing in a new interview. “In my case, suit and tie, every single time I was in any room with loads of people, which is quite often, I was just pouring with sweat, like heart beating — boom, boom, boom, boom — and literally just like a washing machine,” Harry said.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Find out Everything We Know About Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s Wedding!</a></p><p>He also revealed that going to Afghanistan is what helped him ultimately deal with her passing. “If you lose your mum at the age of 12, you have got to deal with it,” Harry began. “The idea that 20 years later I still hadn’t really… that 15, 17 years later I still hadn’t dealt with it. Afghan was the moment where I was like, ‘Right, deal with it.'”</p><p>In the BBC documentary, Mind Over Marathon, his big bro, William, also opened up about their mom’s passing. “The shock is the biggest thing.
