She assisted in the treatment of the author’s late father until his death in 2014, according to the author’s husband.</p><h2>Relationship in the Past</h2><p>In 2009, Sarah married professional basketballer Robert Henson. However, the two divorced in 2012, and Sarah claimed on her official website, sarahdhenson.com, that she feared for her safety:</p><p>Henson wrote, “I have agreed to end my four-year marriage after professional therapy and prayerful thought.” There are biblical reasons for this decision, and I have exhausted all other options, but after several infractions over the course of the marriage, and for my own and my children’s protection, I have made this difficult decision.</p><h2>Children of Sarah Jakes Roberts</h2><p>Sarah Jakes Roberts has six children with her parents.</p><p>Makenzie Henson (in collaboration with Robert Henson)<br>Isaiah Roberts (Wife’s previous relationship)<br>Ella Roberts (with Touré, her husband)<br>Malachi Jakes (Sarah’s ex-boyfriend)<br>Ren Taylor Roberts (with Touré, her husband)<br>Teya Roberts (husband’s ex-girlfriend)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Sarah-Jakes-Roberts-Children-Son-Daughter.JPG><p>Sarah became pregnant at the age of 14 with an unknown individual, which came as a shock to the Jakes family. Sarah’s parents were shocked, emotionally devastated, and crushed on the inside, but they didn’t hold back. Instead, they rose to the occasion and triumphed over the adversity.</p><p>Jakes, the bishop of The Potter’s House, said that the press had flocked to the church to report on the incident further. He, on the other hand, declined to answer any of the questions, claiming that it was a private matter. It wasn’t about being ashamed or self-conscious about his appearance; it was about his daughter’s safety.</p><h2>Sarah’s father demonstrated that love triumphs over all</h2><p>Sarah admitted that she had disappointed her parents when asked. She was well aware that they had high expectations, and she is now wary of making any mistakes.</p><p>“No matter what you’ve done,” Sarah explained, “there’s always a way back to the right path.”</p><p>Despite the fact that her pregnancy caused hardship for her family, she believed it was the best thing in the world because she learned how much her parents love her.</p><h2>Sarah welcomed her son Malachi Jakes after all of the difficulties</h2><p>Robert and Touré welcomed their first daughter, Ren Taylor Roberts, on February 10, 2016, and their second daughter, Ella Roberts, on February 10, 2016.</p><p>Sarah had a daughter, Makenzie Henson, with Robert Henson, who is now 11 years old, and Touré had a daughter, Teya Roberts, and a son, Isaiah Roberts, from previous relationships (born 2002).</p><h2>Wikimedia Commons has media related to Siblings and Family</h2><p>T.D Jakes (father) and Serita Jakes (mother) are Sarah’s parents (mother).
