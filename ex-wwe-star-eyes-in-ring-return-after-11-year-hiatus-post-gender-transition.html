Tuft eventually asked for her release from WWE, as she simply wanted to spend more time with her family. Now she seems to be eyeing a return to the squared circle after a decade.</p><p><a href=#>It was previously said that Gabbi Tuft&nbsp;</a>felt like she escaped from prison when&nbsp;<a href=#>she revealed that she was transitioning into being woman</a>. Tuft received a ton of support from people all over the world, especially from his wife, Priscilla.</p><p>While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=#>TVInsider</a>, the former Tyler Reks talked about returning to the ring after over a decade out of action. Tuft made it clear that she doesn’t rule out wrestling again after so long.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be opposed to it. I did put my foot back in the ring for the first time in 11 years recently. I went down to the Rhodes Wrestling Academy under Dustin Rhodes, Goldust. I texted him and said that I would love to come down and stick my foot in the ring.</p><p>“He said to come on down. It was an incredible feeling to be back in the ring. Since I did that there has been a huge resurgence and feeling for what I love.</p><p>“It has nothing to do with transitioning and then getting back in the ring to say I’m in the women’s division.</p><p>“Nothing to do with that. It had everything to do with realizing how much I missed the business. I never thought I would wrestle again, but here I am.</p><p>“I had open-heart surgery in July 2019. I said to my doctor, “Hey, review my scans. Am I clear to go wrestle if I want?”</p><p>“I’m hoping to hear back from this week to see if I’m a hundred percent clear. If that’s the case, very shortly I may resume training.”</p><p>Tuft also had&nbsp;<a href=#>her fair share of haters and transphobes</a>, but she has never let them bring her down. Nyla Rose and Giselle Shaw have already paved the way for transgender wrestlers in pro wrestling, so it remains to be seen whether Gabbi Tuft will return to the ring.</p><p>What’s your opinion on what Gabbi Tuft said?
