His incredible body stature gives him a great advantage over his opponents on the field as he plays as a placekicker for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League(NFL).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Anders Carlson&nbsp; career</h2><p>Carlson redshirted his true freshman season at Auburn in 2017 to support his elder brother Daniel as the backup placekicker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/22110610/61932dd8e0cd0.webp?resize=750%2C500&ssl=1"><p>Before he was even a redshirt freshman in 2018, Carlson made waves at Auburn’s practice facility with a 62-yard field goal. He hit 15 of 25 goal tries that season with success, including two that were 53 yards long, the second-longest field goals ever made by a freshman in Auburn program history.</p><p>Along with that, he converted all 44 PATs, going 9 for 9 against Purdue in the 2018 Music City Bowl. Furthermore, out of 70 kickoffs, he forced 51 touchbacks.</p><p>He made his first and only career reception on November 24, 2018, against in-state rival Alabama, a 3-yard catch on a fake field goal play.</p><p>As a placekicker for the SEC Coaches Preseason All-SEC Third Team and SEC Media Preseason All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) Second Team in 2019, Carlson began his redshirt sophomore campaign in 2019.</p><p>After making all four of his field goal attempts from 43 (twice), 44, and 52 yards in Auburn’s 48–45 shock victory over Alabama in the “Iron Bowl,” he was named SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>His fifty-two-yard attempt to make a field goal against Alabama was the longest in Auburn’s Iron Bowl history, sharing the record with his brother Daniel and Al Del Greco.</p><p>His third-quarter field goal against Arkansas broke the NCAA record for the most consecutive successful field goals (303) recorded by Auburn kickers. The streak, which began in 2013 with a field goal by previous Auburn kicker Cody Parkey, lasted six seasons, 78 games, and five different Auburn kickers.</p><p>By the end of the 2019 season, he had made 48 of 49 PATs, 18 of 25 field goals, and 47 touchbacks on 78 kickoffs.</p><p>Carlson was chosen for the Phil Steele All-SEC Fourth Team and the SEC Media Preseason All-SEC Third Team in 2020, as he prepared for his redshirt junior season.</p><p>He converted 24 of 25 PATs and 20 of 22 field goals, including a 50-yarder, during that season. He was chosen twice for the Lou Groza “Star of the Week” roster because of his impressive kicking performances against Mississippi State and Arkansas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/22110534/kgsvpkgz38kpgwakl32e.webp?resize=660%2C495&ssl=1"><p>His 2020 campaign saw him named to the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) FBS Coaches’ All-America Second Team, Phil Steele All-America Honorable Mention, Associated Press (AP) All-SEC First Team, and Lou Groza Award (best placekicker in college football) semifinalist.</p><p>As a redshirt senior in 2021, he completed 35 of 36 PATs and 14 of 21 field goals, including a 49-yarder. He sustained a torn ACL that ended his season during Auburn’s game against Mississippi State on November 13.</p><p>With his career accomplishments, Carlson ranks seventh in Auburn program history in terms of points scored (275), third in terms of field goals made (53), and sixth in terms of point-after-points made (116).</p><p>For Auburn’s spring football games in 2018, 2019, and 2021, Carlson was named Special Teams MVP. Auburn’s COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the 2020 A-Day.</p><p>The Green Bay Packers selected Carlson with the 207th overall pick in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. On May 5, he signed his first contract.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/22110532/anderscarlsonscoutingreport-1024x538.png><p>With thirteen failed kicks in his debut campaign, Carlson led the NFL in that category. Carlson missed a field goal that would have given the Packers a seven-point lead and caused the 49ers to tie the game instead of taking the lead in the Divisional Round playoff game versus the Packers.</p><p>Both head coach Matt LaFleur and Carlson’s colleagues from the Packers came out in favor of Carlson, with LaFleur saying that the loss wasn’t entirely due to Carlson’s botched attempt.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqlnZ2iqHqkrdGlqqimXZ2yqrPHrWShp6diwaK4y2agrGWRo7GmvtJmmpqqnKi8r3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bryce-rhodes-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bryce Rhodes Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-brody-gushes-about-wife-leighton-meester-in-a-rare-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Brody Offers Rare Reveal on How He Met Wife Leighton Meester</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
