Season 2, Episode 10 was filled with tons of love and heartbreak, and the reunion serves as the final confirmation for where many of the couples stand. Thanks to social media, we know just where one happily uncoupled pair — <a href=#>Deepti Vempati and Abhishek “Shake” Chatterjee</a> — stand in their relationship.</p><p>It’s no secret that Shake had a lot of disrespectful things to say about Deepti throughout the season. This led to fans hoping that the two wouldn’t go through with the marriage. Thankfully, Deepti chose herself and walked away. However, once Deepti’s family caught wind of Shake’s commentary about her, all hell broke loose via social media. Deepti’s brother had some choice words for Shake, and Shake has seemingly clapped back. Here’s the 4-1-1.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Deepti’s brother, Sunny Vempati, called Shake a loser in an open letter on Instagram.</h2><p>On Feb. 27, 2022, Sunny Vempati and his wife, Hina Merchant Vempati, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to defend Deepti’s honor. After watching Season 2 of Love Is Blind, the pair took issue with how Shake spoke about Deepti behind her back. So, they took to social media to call Shake out on his nonsense.</p><p>Before ripping Shake a new one on social media, the pair first shared their love and support for Deepti and wrote about how proud they are that “she’s inspired people to realize their self worth.” Then, the tables turned with some choice words for Shake.</p><p>“Now, normally I don’t get involved in drama, but I’m gonna defend my sister here: Shake ... you’re a loser,” Sunny and Hina wrote. “You minimized my sister’s life by making some awful and cringe-worthy comments about her. You made these statements knowing your own mom would one day watch it; my parents and my entire family had to sit through you talking behind my sister’s back about insecurities she fought her entire life.”</p><p>Sunny and Hina went on to share that Shake’s portrayal on the show was not due to editing, but were his actual thoughts about Deepti. For folks that have not been following, Shake has repeatedly said on various occasions that he’s not attracted to Deepti. He also went so far to compare her to his aunt.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Deepti’s brother tore Shake’s singlet on IG and I’m here for all of it ☺️</p>— liv🌺 (@Oliviangelic) <a href=#>March 1, 2022</a></figure><p>“In spite of your best efforts to pretend this was all fictional and it was because of the ‘edit,’ no one forced you to say those words,” they added. “We welcomed you into our home, and you saw it as an opportunity for clout, so forgive me if I’m not sympathetic towards you and the hate you’re receiving.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Shake shared that he's not sorry for his behavior toward Deepti in a video on Instagram.</h2><p>Shake knows just how to get under people's skin. After Deepti's brother and his wife, Sunny Vempati and Hina Merchant-Vempati, publicly called out Shake for being disrespectful, social media praised the couple for standing up for what's right. Everyone agrees that Shake deserved every bit of the tongue-lashing from the couple, but the veterinarian doesn't seem phased by the open letter. In fact, he claims that he's not sorry for his behavior.</p><p>On March 1, 2022, Shake took to Instagram to share that while there are some things he knows he needs to work on with himself, apologizing for certain things is out of the question.</p><p>"One thing I don’t feel inclined to do is pretend I’m sad or sorry about certain things — certain things that were out of my control, certain things that I can’t necessarily even speak about. I’m just not going to do that. I’m not sorry," he said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Abhishek 'Shake' Chatterjee (@thepuppydoc)</a></p></figure><p>While he didn't necessarily name Deepti, his video follows Sunny and Hina's open letter that called him out. So, it's safe to assume that he's not feeling sorry about what he's said about Deepti.</p><p>Shake then went on to share that nobody has to like him and that he's responsible for liking himself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>OMG @ this Love Is Blind Tea from Reddit</p><p>- Shayne was caught “skiing” multiple times</p><p>- He & Natalie fought for weeks BTS before the wedding blowout</p><p>- Shake wanted to humiliate Deepti at the wedding but the producers hated him so much they told her to break it off first <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dgdOedqvYZ</a></p>— Reaux @ The Female Dating Strategy (@Reaux_FDS) <a href=#>February 28, 2022</a></figure><p>Making matters worse, a Love Is Blind Reddit post has gone viral about Shake allegedly wanting to humiliate Deepti by being the one to say no to the marriage first. However, since the producer could not stand him, Deepti was allegedly told to break it off first. However, neither Shake nor Deepti has confirmed if the news is true.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by sunny (@sunnyvmpt)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Deepti and Shake appear to be at odds.</h2><p>After walking away from a romantic future with Shake for good, it appears that Deepti doesn’t want to have anything to do with him. Not only did Deepti share that Shake will regret how he treated her, it seems as if there is some bad blood between them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Most of the Love Is Blind Season 2 cast follow each other on social media, but that’s not the case for Deepti and Shake. The mutual beef shouldn't come as much of a surprise, since he really had a lot of negative things to say about her, but it has also lead fans to believe that something went down on the Season 2 finale between them.</p><p>Even if Shake apologizes for what he’s said about Deepti, the damage is already done. And with her family also icing him out, it’s safe to say that the two won’t be cordial anytime soon.</p><p>Love Is Blind Seasons 1 and 2 are available for streaming now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ2dlaXBqnnBq6atoJWneq271Z5koqtdl7mqusM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mia-kaplan-find-her-wiki-age-and-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mia Kaplan?
