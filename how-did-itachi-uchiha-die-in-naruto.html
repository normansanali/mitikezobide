Older brother to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sasuke</a>, Itachi was traumatized by the aftermath of the Third Shinobi War, which inspired him to train hard as a child and eventually serve as an Anbu Captain at a young age.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>However, one fateful night, Itachi kills the entire Uchiha clan — including his parents — sparing only Sasuke. In turn, the youngest of the last two Uchiha grows up with the desire to avenge his clan and spends the majority of his adolescence directing his energies toward training and getting stronger, strong enough to face his sibling in battle. Meanwhile, Itachi joins the Akatsuki and has several clashes with Sasuke and the other shinobi over time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>It is important to note that Itachi dies twice in Naruto — the first time, after an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">epic confrontation with his brother</a>, Sasuke, and after he is reincarnated by Kabuto during the Fourth Shinobi War, Itachi’s soul eventually returns to the afterlife.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-two-deaths-of-itachi-uchiha data-injectable=false>The two deaths of Itachi Uchiha&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/itachi-sasuke.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Although Itachi technically died once and was brought back briefly against his will, the man died a thousand deaths throughout his life, owing to the trauma he had to endure and internalize all his life. Forced to portray himself as a villain to the point of alienating his brother and having the entire shinobi world turn against him, Itachi has always led a double life and was never free to carry out what his heart truly yearned for.</p><p data-characters=620 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>In Naruto Shippuden episode 138, appropriately titled “The End,” Itachi and Sasuke engage in a fight, in which the latter attacks the former viciously. For the most part, Itachi is able to evade the attacks due to his Susanoo. However, in an attempt to defeat his elder brother by any means, Sasuke releases <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Orochimaru</a>, who wishes to take over Sasuke’s body. Itachi succeeds in keeping Orochimaru at bay and successfully removes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sasuke’s cursed seal</a>, which he’d unwillingly earned at the Forty-Fourth Training Ground, better known as the Forest of Death, during the second stage of the Chūnin&nbsp;exams.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>By this time, at the end of the fight, Itachi’s chakra is all used up, and just when Sasuke thinks it’s over for him, Itachi pokes his forehead — a recreation of the endearing love language they shared as siblings when they were children. This gesture also seals Amaterasu in Sasuke’s eyes. With his last breath, Itachi apologizes to Sasuke, smiles, and passes away.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>Countless episodes later, during the&nbsp;Fourth Shinobi World War&nbsp;and after he is reanimated by Kabuto, Itachi finds a way to end the Impure World Reincarnation. His final words to Sasuke involve the truth, and then he bumps their foreheads, acknowledging his brother as his equal. Before passing away, he tells Sasuke that he does not expect forgiveness from him, but will always love him no matter what.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Did Sasuke actually kill Itachi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Design-sem-nome-94-1.png><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Among the Naruto fandom, there is a popular belief that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Itachi was not truly killed by his brother</a>. He allowed Sasuke to have the kill to an extent, helping him become stronger and free of his curse in the process. Itachi was already close to death when Sasuke came to face him, his sickness would have eventually claimed him had the battle with his sibling not sped up the process.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditor wrote</a>: “Itachi could have won if he really wanted to get Sasuke’s eyes.” Which is not an absurd, baseless opinion. Nor is it to think that Itachi — in his own highly complex, sometimes contradictory, and often mysterious way — always had his brother’s best interests at heart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBllJ6xbrXTmpqhoV2qsKm1x5pknaGVYravec2aqa6sn2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-puka-nacua-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How much money does Puka Nacua make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-leyva.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Leyva Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
