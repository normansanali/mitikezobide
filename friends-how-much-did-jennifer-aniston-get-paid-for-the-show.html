As such, the first season of the show saw its lead actors making a modest sum of money compared to what they would eventually make down the road.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jennifer Aniston, along with the other lead actors on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Friends</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, would take in $22,500 each episode during the first season of the show, according to Business Insider. No, it’s not a number that is nearly as high as people are expecting, but for someone trying to make it in the business, this must have been a nice chunk of change at first.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>One thing that would happen as time went on is that the cast would get steady increases in pay as the seasons went along. This, of course, is due to the show becoming a massive hit with audiences of all ages. By the time season 5 rolled around, the cast of the show was finally making <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100,000 each episode</a>, which is no chump change.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As nice as it was that their pay increased quite dramatically over the years, their six-figure pay would pale in comparison to their highest-paying season, which set the bar for other performers on other top shows.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Jennifer Aniston Does To Look Younger Than Her 51 Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=million-dollar-rachel>Million Dollar Rachel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0FF87B7A-419C-40D1-8A4C-124C9134DE1C.jpeg><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Friends </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>was the hottest show on television, and the cast was netting six figures per episode, but as the world would quickly see, the money train kept rolling in and growing as the show marched towards its conclusion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Entering the show’s ninth season, it was clear that the actors were seeking higher pay. After all, the series had been a mainstay on the network for years and it was still blowing others show’s viewership out the water. Many figured that the cast could make a little bit more, but seeing as how they were already making $750,000 each episode, per </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Business Insider</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, there was belief that there was very little room to negotiate.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Once the cast made their demands, the network decided to play ball, and each member got a significant pay boost. Their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 million pay</a> for each episode of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Friends</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was a total game changer that shocked the industry. It is exceptionally rare to see someone make this type of money, but the entire cast pulling down a salary like this is just wild.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This wound up being the salary that the cast would make for the final two seasons of the show, meaning that they were lining their pockets as much as possible before the show was finally yanked from the network. What’s important to note here is that the show’s massive success meant that it was in line for syndication, which was only going to make the cast of the show all the richer.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Adam Sandler And Jennifer Aniston First Met</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-money-train-keeps-rolling>The Money Train Keeps Rolling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/B5D341C5-46D5-434C-91EB-63EAAEDB34F2.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, as many people are aware, the $1 million per episode pay that the cast was getting was a massive number at the time, but this is nothing compared to how things have been playing out for everyone involved in the series since the show ended. In fact, it’s only the beginning.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Given that </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Friends</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> is still one of the most popular shows of all time, it has continued to haul in a ton of money for its network. What this means is that the cast of the show, thanks to some nifty negotiating, has been collecting on royalties this entire time! The crazy thing about this is that their royalties are more than enough to retire on each year.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>CinemaBlend</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> reports that the cast of the show makes around $20 million each year just off of royalties from the series. This means that all of the work that they did 20 years ago is still making them more money that some people will generate in their entire lives. Naturally, the cast does not have to do much these days, but they still take on projects.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things We Learned From Jennifer Aniston & Lisa Kudrow’s Recent Revealing Interview</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jennifer Aniston went from modest pay to superstar salary back when the show was on the air, and these days, she gets to sit back and laugh all the way to the bank as the hard work she put in back in the day continues to make her massive amount of cash.</span></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Actually Made Two Of Her Friends Co-Stars Cry</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0eceormalpZi1brDInWSjnZ6jtqex0WaYp6Gjqbyvecaeq2aokZ6xbrLOq2StoJViwKm71mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-reed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Golf's Captain America, Patrick Reed is a professional golfer!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexa-love-is-blind-step-mom-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans of Love Is Blind Are Curious to Know What Her Age Is!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
