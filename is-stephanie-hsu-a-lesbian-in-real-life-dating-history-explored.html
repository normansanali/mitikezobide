Her inability to truly accept her queer child jeopardizes the entire multiverse.</span></p><p><u><span>Hsu shared that</span></u><span>&nbsp;working on the movie “was the most inspiring, artistic experience she has ever had.”</span></p><p><span>She is very thankful for the groundbreaking, genre-defying film, which has helped many fans come out to their parents.</span></p><p><span>“My dream for art is to be able to heal people and make the world a better place,” she once said.</span></p><p><span>“I have had so many people, esp. Asian Americans come up to me just saying, ‘Thank you so much for this film. I’ve never seen anything like it, and it tells my family’s story,’” Hsu expressed happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“They will just start crying and say, ‘I don’t know how you guys did it, but I see myself in that story,’” added Hsu at one screening.</span></p><p>However, the actress is guarded when it comes to her private life.

Her alter ego is Jobu Tupaki, Alpha-Evelyn’s omnicidal daughter and a colorful, godly threat to the multiverse.</span></p><p><span>Already in a strained relationship with her mother, Joy desperately wants her mom to accept her non-Chinese girlfriend, Becky Sregor (Tallie Medel).</span></p><p>However, Hsu feels that it’s not pushed. According to her, the people in the film “happen to be Chinese, happen to be gay,” and “are trying to figure this freaking crazy chaotic life out.”</p><p><span>Her nomination for best supporting actress for this role has left LGBTQ+ fans overjoyed. Many queer viewers believe that the relationships depicted in the film are rarely seen on the big screen.</span></p><p><span>The actress has previously spoken about what the film means to LGBTQ+ and Chinese people, talking to&nbsp;</span><span>Out</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>“When I read the script, a queer love story felt so obvious; an Asian family is so obvious because that’s also my life,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Everything Everywhere All at Once</span><span>&nbsp;leads the Oscar nominations this year with 11 nods. Hsu is up against her castmate Jamie Lee Curtis and Cate Blanchett for&nbsp;</span><span>Tar</span><span>, among others.</span></p><p><strong><span>Find Out</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>Who Is Siniša Mačković?
