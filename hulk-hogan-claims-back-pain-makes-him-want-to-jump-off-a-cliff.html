However, Hogan has been plagued with numerous health issues over the years. In fact, Hogan recently claimed that his back pain makes him want to jump off a cliff.</p><p>Hulk Hogan is a legendary figure in the world of professional wrestling, with his name being synonymous with the sport. While he has done a lot of questionable things over the years, none of that has erased his significance in the business.</p><p>The Hulkster has been plagued with a myriad of back problems over the years due to his using the leg drop as his finisher. He ended up having 10 surgeries on his back&nbsp;so far in his life.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Chris Van Vliet of Insight</a>, the WWE Hall of Famer talked about the physical toll his injuries have taken on him over the years. Hogan even claimed that after enduring so many back surgeries, the pain makes him feel that he would rather jump off a cliff than live another day.</p><p>“I can’t push a glass door open. Even in the gym it’s short strokes, I can’t straighten my arms out. And it’s the same with my knees and my hips, my back, my neck. But that’s because I probably wrestled too long and I didn’t get the memo that that stuff was fake [laughs.] And I don’t complain about it because like I was telling Sky [his wife] she goes ‘Well how much pain are you in?’ And I tell her I’m in pain all the time but I’m used to it.</p><p>I had a physical therapist ask me the other day ‘If you could be out of pain, or you could have a perfect championship walk [to the ring] which would you rather have?’ And I said ‘I’d rather have the walk.’ She goes ‘You’re out of your mind!’ And I tell her ‘Yes I am’ because everything hurts just like, just like gum. It’s hard to explain but when I brush my teeth and I lean on the counter to brush my teeth, I can’t push away. So when I’m done brushing my teeth I have to lean in and then pull back.</p><p>I’ve been down that road with the pain pills. The last 12 years, I’ve had 25 surgeries. The knees, the hips, ten back surgeries and a couple shoulder surgeries. Abdominal surgeries, orbital socket surgery. So I know what it’s like when the doctor goes ‘Here’s your prescription.’ Sometimes, when you’re in such pain after seven, right, nine, ten back surgeries, you’d rather just jump off a cliff than live another day. It’s real easy to fall in that situation and a lot of other wrestlers who have passed away have fallen into that situation.</p><p>It’s just more natural way to walk things back. A more natural way to get on track and get back to normal. So it makes a lot of sense for a lot of reasons to me.”</p><p>The Hulkster also <a href=#>hopes he doesn’t need to have his 11th back surgery</a>. It is sad to see the WWE Hall of Famer enduring such pain on a daily basis and we hope he will eventually get better in due time.</p><p>What do you think of what Hulk Hogan said?
