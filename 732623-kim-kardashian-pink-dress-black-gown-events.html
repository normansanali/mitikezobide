She managed to not only make it to both of them, but absolutely slay both of them in the process. The first came in Los Angeles where she was in attendance at the LACMA Art & Film Gala. She absolutely nailed the event with an eye-popping pink Balenciaga dress and contrasting black gloves.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It wasn't until after the event that fans got another look at the fit though. Some behind-the-scenes pictures of Kardashian at the event made it to social media. While some show her relaxing on her phone there was one in particular that fans latched onto. In the picture she's in the bathroom after the event with her dress zipped all the way down. It's far from the first time fans have gotten a peek at Kim's butt, though it tends to make headline news every time. Check out the snapshots below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kim-kardashians-cheeky-moment>Kim Kardashians Cheeky Moment</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kim Kardashian's second event in just a few days was the CFDA Fashion Awards in New York. For this event she went with a similarly stunning black Chrome Hearts gown. The dress is duster with gothic textures and Kardashian chose to leave the back open in order to show off her legs.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kim Kardashian's shapewear company SKIMS has been busy recently. Last week they <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">teamed up with Swarovski</a> for some uniquely shiny shapewear pieces. She also broke the internet once again with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the company's Faux Nipple bra</a>. The bra was seen as a joke by many when it was first announced but it turned out to be an entirely real effort to combat climate change. She followed it up the very next day with the announcement that SKIMS had become the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">official shapewear brand of the NBA</a>.
