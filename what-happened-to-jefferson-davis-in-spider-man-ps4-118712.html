Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p><h2>When did Jefferson Davis appear in Spider-Man?</h2><p>In the comics, Jefferson Davis first appeared in Ultimate Comics<strong> Spider-Man</strong> vol<strong>. 2 #1 (November 2011).</strong></p><p>Comic book history. All appearances. Original appearance. Jefferson “Jeff” Davis is<strong> a supporting character in Marvel’s Spider-Man.</strong> He is the father of Miles Morales and a member of the New York Police Department. Officer Davis is voiced by Russell Richardson.</p><p>Officer Davis is called to the scene of a shipyard owned by Fisk in<strong> order to assist Spider-Man in his investigation.</strong> Together, the two unlock the secrets hidden inside, coming up against the Inner Demons who are attempting to steal equipment. Davis helps in their eventual apprehension, but is injured in the process.</p><p>Characteristics. Officer Davis is<strong> a middle-aged African-American man with a bald head and slim physique.</strong> He is always seen wearing his police uniform. Davis is shown to be a selfless and good-natured individual who in many ways embodies the ideal cop.</p><p>Davis was born in<strong> New York City</strong> around the year 1974. Not much of his past is known besides that he had a brother named Aaron. He began working for the NYPD around 2001, and had a son named Miles with his wife Rio Morales around 2003. According to Yuri Watanabe, Officer Davis had been investigating Wilson Fisk ‘s activities for years.</p><p>As for his brother, Aaron Davis, known as the Prowler, despite the hatred they had in the past, When Jeff was alive, he still cared and loved his brother, and Aaron never wanted his him dead. This was the reason why Prowler tried to stop Spider-Man (Miles Morales) from risking his life, not wanting to lose him, just like he lost his brother.</p><p>The Inner Demons, led by<strong> Mister Negative,</strong> arrive, with a number of them carrying explosives. When the Deputy Mayor is revealed to be one of them and tries to detonate his bomb in the crowd, Davis tackles him and shields other officers on guard using his body, sacrificing his life to protect the crowd.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>Where is Jefferson Davis’ grave?</h2><p>Jefferson Davis’ Grave Location in<strong> Harlem</strong> in Miles Morales. The Never Give Up trophy’s description reads: Pay respects at Jefferson Davis’ grave in<strong> Harlem.</strong> Obviously, the grave is found somewhere in<strong> Harlem</strong> but actually finding his grave can be quite the task.</p><p>Spider-Man:<strong> Miles Morales is finally out on</strong> PS5 and PS4 and instead of the story focusing on Peter Parker, this time we’re treated to a standalone adventure that puts Miles in the forefront as he works to save Harlem from a villain known as the Tinkerer.</p><h2>Who rams the truck in Spider-Man?</h2><p>As Spider-Man pulls the tanker to safety, one of the Demons attempts to ram the hero with a truck. At the very last minute, Officer<strong> Davis</strong> rams the truck with his squad car, saving the day. What a hero! He’s sure to be one of Peter’s greatest, longest-lasting friends.</p><p>Following up with Yuri regarding the Demons, Spider-Man learns that<strong> the gang has been ransacking Fisk-owned properties all evening.</strong> He heads off to the docks, to a Fisk building that’s yet to be attacked, to lie in wait. Yuri sends Officer Jefferson Davis to help Spider-Man out.</p><p>Spider-Man takes down the Vulture and Electro. He’s poisoned by Scorpion, but manages to break through some powerful hallucinations and create a cure. Scorpion and Rhino go down after a pretty epic battle.</p><p>After a trip into town to help his police officer friends repair their surveillance towers, which everyone is not at all uncomfortable with, Peter swings back by the lab<strong> to repair his tattered suit.</strong> Octavius catches him at work but seems to assume Peter is simply working on the tech for his friend, Spider-Man.</p><p>Once Spider-Man recovers from his beating, he discovers a city in<strong> shambles.</strong> The Sinister Six are running rampant. Silver Sable’s men are taking advantage of the chaos, roughing up citizens and stealing. Escaped convicts have begun setting up bases throughout the city. Peter can hardly swing without being targeted by a sniper rifle or rocket launcher. Oh, and Otto’s released Devil’s Breath, and people are starting to die.</p><p>When players aren’t caught up in solving random crimes, performing optional missions or basking in the sheer joy of swinging around Insomniac’s New York City,<strong> Spider-Man for the PS4 tells a classic Spidey tale that shouldn’t be missed. In</strong> case you are missing it, here’s what happens.</p><p>On his way to Fisk Tower, Spidey receives a call from his best police friend,<strong> Captain Yuri Watanabe.</strong> She asks our hero to stop by Times Square to help a police squad that’s pinned down by some of Fisk’s men. It’s a tutorial.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbEn52eqqOku26wwK%2BgrGWZo3q0vMidnKtlnZa7brzSbWRqaWhsfnN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-rylee-arnold-the-new-dancing-with-the-stars-pro-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Rylee Arnold?
