But it’s certainly worth arguing that the most shocking and upsetting death belongs to<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glenn Rhee</a></strong> (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Yeun</a>) — whose demise undoubtedly changed the seriousness and the entire landscape of the show as a whole.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>As one of the earliest characters in the series, Glenn is introduced to audiences when he saves a stumbling, disoriented Rick Grimes after he awakens from his coma. Unbeknownst to Rick, he woke up to a buzzing apocalyptic world which had been overrun by zombies. Luckily, Glenn saves the day, and the two eventually form a close bond which turns into a larger group down the line.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>But as much as Glenn was considered to be a fan favorite, in the vein of Game of Thrones, he was eventually killed off — a decision that definitely traumatized an entire collection of devoted fans. So, let’s dive in and explore exactly when Glenn died, and precisely how it happened.</p><h2 id=h-what-episode-does-glenn-die data-injectable=false>What episode does Glenn die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/glenn-rhee-walking-dead.png><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true>Much like his fate in the Walking Dead comics, Glenn tragically dies in the premiere episode of the seventh season, “The Day Will Come When You Won’t Be.” During the episode’s opening minutes, over 17 million viewers watched in sheer panic as he suffered his long-anticipated fate — and for those that read the comics beforehand, Glenn’s death definitely wasn’t a shock.</p><h2 id=h-how-does-glenn-die data-injectable=false>How does Glenn die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/glenn-negan-walking-dead.png><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>In a death as inevitable as they come (and you can deny it all you want), Glenn ultimately suffers his fate at the hands of series villain Negan. After feeling enraged by Rick’s group and because of a recent outburst from Daryl Dixon, Negan takes it upon himself to execute both Abraham and Glenn. One could argue that the latter takes the worst of the two beatings, with Negan smashing his head in until his brains were absolute mush and his eyeballs were dangling from its sockets.</p><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>In the aftermath of Glenn’s demise, the ever-present Walking Dead fanbase was collectively distraught — with a considerable portion of fans even threatening to stop watching the show. Interestingly, by the time the second episode of the seventh season rolled around, viewership had decreased by five million viewers. So, it’s worth entertaining the idea that many fans quit watching once Glenn died, and that would make perfect sense, seeing as Glenn truly was a beloved character.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>But with Negan and Maggie’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Walking Dead spin-off</a> on the horizon, perhaps we’ll be learning more about Glenn and hearing a few name drops in the process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ6omai8pbGMnaaeq12cuaa6zWabop1dnrtuwMeeZLCZnKC2r7OMnZyanF2Wu6V5x6iuZpyfmsButdNmn5qooJq7cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-really-is-yourrage-wiki-bio-age-height-girlfriend-net-worth-555231-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who REALLY is YourRAGE?
