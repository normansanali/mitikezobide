From starting off as a child actor and successfully transitioning to an adult actor, Roberts has proven that she has talent in spades.</p><p>While Roberts is best known for her work these days on 'American Horror Story' and 'Scream Queens', she has done some incredible film work that has made a fortune for studios. And with multiple projects in the hopper waiting to be completed, Roberts' face will again be in the spotlight.</p><p>With Roberts returning to 'AHS', it is unclear how long her stint on the show will be, especially since it was greenlit for another season. Regardless of what direction Roberts' career takes her at this point, it appears it is only going to be up given the performances she has given and how in demand she is on both the big and small screens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-robert-rsquo-s-early-days>Emma Robert’s Early Days</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-24-1.jpg><p>While it’s unclear how much she made starring alongside Johnny Depp in 2001’s Blow, considering that this was her big-screen debut, the opportunity to appear opposite the A-list star would have certainly given Roberts a boost to jumpstart her career and land further roles, all of which may have started by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">visiting her Aunt Julia on set.</a></p><p>"You’d have to drag me off set. Like, I would go and visit, and my mom would be like, 'Aren’t you bored? Don’t you want to leave?’' And I’m like, 'No, I’m working in hair and makeup now.’'And my mom would be like, ‘You’re seven.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to star in two low-budget movies, Grand Champion and Spymate, before landing her next major role right after turning 13. This was when Nickelodeon cast her as Addie Singer in the sitcom Unfabulous, which ran from 2004 to 2007.</p><p>The show attracted millions of viewers, running for three seasons and landing Roberts an opportunity to give singing a try. Under Columbia and Nick Records, she released a soundtrack and debut album for the show in 2005, titled Unfabulous and More, which included the singles Dummy and I Wanna Be.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/is-emma-roberts-a-toxic-and-problematic-actress_-the-truth-about-her-alleged-feuds-following-angelica-ross-accusations.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is Emma Roberts A Toxic Actress?

There was little to no doubt that the best was yet to come for the blonde beauty.</p><p>Doing commercial work can be very lucrative depending on the deal, and though her salary was never disclosed for these projects, considering that she’s quite literally always has a commercial on TV, we’d say she’s not only in high demand but is also earning a substantial amount from the many TV ads she’s done over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-roberts-becomes-a-regular-on-american-horror-story>Emma Roberts Becomes A Regular On American Horror Story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52835457.png><p>In late 2013, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she joined the cast of American Horror Story</a> for its third series, which was somewhat considered a TV comeback.

When Roberts took a hiatus from AHS, fans were not sure if she would be coming back or not. But, be it a <a href=#>big payday or just a desire to return to the acclaimed series</a>, Roberts returned for Season 12, Delicate, which also has appearances by Kim Kardashian.</p><p>With Season 13 being confirmed, whether Roberts will be returning for yet another season remains to be seen.

Hopefully, with seven projects completed or close to, 2024 and 2025 will prove to be the years that the films are released.
