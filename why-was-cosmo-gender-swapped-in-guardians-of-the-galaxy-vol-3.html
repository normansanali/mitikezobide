Across the board, the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy is seen as one of the franchise’s clear success stories, but that doesn’t shield the releases from criticism. Some criticism is more unfounded than others, of course, and few people are really all that concerned with a side character’s gender swap.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>A side character who also happens to be a dog, don’t forget. While it is true that James Gunn made the decision to change <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmo the Space Dog</a></strong> from male to female, it wasn’t an issue for most fans. For those that care, however, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">change was absolutely unforgivable</a> — despite Gunn’s valid reason for doing so.</p><h2 id=h-why-is-cosmo-female-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3 data-injectable=false>Why is Cosmo female in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Quite a few characters appear across Guardians of the Galaxy releases, and — of them all — Cosmo is relatively inconsequential. She played a far more important role in Vol. 3, but overall the cheery pupper is little more than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a charming side character</a>. She’s also female, in the MCU, diverting from her comic book origins.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Except, Cosmo didn’t truly originate in Marvel comics. Sure, the character did — back in 2008 — but the telepathic space dog is actually based on a real-life hero. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmo serves as a nod</a> to Laika, one of the first animals to ever travel to space. The Soviet space dog flew aboard the Sputnik 2&nbsp;spacecraft back in 1957, before she was tragically killed by overheating on her fourth orbit.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Laika’s survival was never expected, given the limitations of technology at the time, but she’s since become a hugely necessary step in discovering the biological effects of spaceflight. Her sacrifice paved the way for human space travel several years later, and she’s remembered as an unfortunate, but necessary, sacrifice in exploring the perils of space.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Cosmo was always a reference to Laika, so — when James Gunn decided to incorporate the character into the Guardians story — he wanted the connection to be as clear as possible. As such, he altered Cosmo’s gender from male to female, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hopes of better honoring</a> the actual dog behind her character.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=false>That’s it, that’s the whole explanation. It isn’t about feminism or the “woke” agenda, its about actual historical accuracy. Obviously a telepathic (and telekinetic) dog that argues about whether she classifies as “good” or “bad” has tenuous connections to reality, but that tiny nod from Gunn pays respect to an unsuspecting pup more than 50 years after she was sacrificed for the sake of scientific advancement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGxXayutHnCqKqmp12csq%2BwxKtkrK%2BRpb2msIyipWafpZa%2FpbXAp6pmp5ZiwamxjKCYpZmornq3u8tmamg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-christening-outfit-ideas-inspiration.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What to wear to a christening in 2024: Outfit ideas and inspiration for Christening guests</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
