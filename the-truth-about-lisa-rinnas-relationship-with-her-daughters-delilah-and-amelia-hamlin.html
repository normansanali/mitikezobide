Let's take a look inside Lisa's relationship with her two daughters.</p><h2 id=delilah>Delilah</h2><p>Lisa Rinna has recently&nbsp;been in the news as her daughter Amelia is now dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Disick</a>, who is 38 to her 20 years old, and Lisa has talked about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> whether she should refer to Scott as "lord."</a>&nbsp;But what about Lisa's relationship with her other daughter, Delilah?</p><p>Lisa and Delilah seem to have a great bond, and Delilah <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got people talking when she wore Lisa's dress</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;People, Lisa picked out a Versace dress that she put on for the Oscars ceremony back in 1998, and Delilah put it on, too. Lisa posted a picture on&nbsp;social media of her wearing the dress and of Delilah in it, and she got nostalgic for a moment when she wrote, "I was 6 1/2 months pregnant with @delilahbelle we were going to the 1998 #Oscars and @phillipbloch had @versace make me this dress! Here Delilah wears the dress I was pregnant with her in! Can you Believe?!"</p><p>Delilah posted herself wearing the dress to her Instagram stories and wrote, "Got to try on mama's vintage versace that she wore while pregnant with me." This was definitely a nice walk down memory lane for mom and daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Of The Longest Lasting ‘Real Housewives’ Marriages</a></span></p><h2 id=amelia>Amelia</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin have a sweet love story</a> and it's interesting to learn how they met. According to&nbsp;The List, Lisa was an employee at a store that sold eyeglasses, and she showed up at a restaurant to give the owner the keys. Harry was friends with the store's owner and so he was there, and&nbsp;they first met each other. Harry said,&nbsp;"It was sparks right away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa and Harry tied the knot in 1997 and gave birth to Delilah in 1998 and Amelia in 2001.</p><p>Fans of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&nbsp;have seen many scenes where Lisa goes to a cafe or restaurant with her daughters and they seem to have a really nice, supportive relationship.</p><p>Amelia spends a lot of time with her family, and&nbsp;in June 2021,&nbsp;Amelia got together with her mom and grandmother. This was a huge deal since they hadn't been able to spend time with Lois, Lisa's fabulous mom who fans of&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;remember seeing on the show, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Amelia, Lois, and Lisa danced in an adorable video that Amelia and Lisa both posted to their Instagram accounts. It looked like they were having an amazing time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Producers Of ‘Real Housewives’ Do A Lot More Than Fans Think</a></span></p><h2 id=a-supportive-mom>A&nbsp;Supportive Mom</h2><p>Whenever people have negative comments about Amelia or Delilah, Lisa Rinna is super quick to defend them and support them, and it's nice to see how she always has Amelia and Delilah's backs. While she did say that it was a huge surprise to hear about Amelia dating an older person,</p><p>According to&nbsp;E! News, Lisa and Delilah were dancing to the Madonna song "Who's That Girl," and when Lisa put up a video on her Instagram account, someone said, "Pimping out your daughter. Sad."

News, Lisa wrote to someone and said, "What is wrong with you? This is my child."</p><p>Lisa has also been super supportive of Amelia's struggles with an eating disorder. When people said that maybe Amelia was making it up, which is definitely a terrible thing to say, she shared that she wasn't all that excited about shooting the reality show. According to&nbsp;People, Amelia said,&nbsp;"I seriously can’t believe I’m being accusing of lying about anorexia to get more 'air time' sorry but I’m forced to be on the housewives by my mom. Ask anyone it’s the last thing I want to do. I couldn’t care less about air time."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why ‘RHOBH’ Star Kathy Hilton Will Never Be A Full-Time Housewife</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RHOBH&nbsp;viewers have seen Lisa's parenting in action as Amelia moved to New York City, struggled with depression, and came back to Los Angeles. In an interview with&nbsp;Women's Health, Amelia talked about how much she appreciated that Lisa and Harry were supportive and kind about her moving home. She said,&nbsp;"Sometimes it's hard to accept what you are going through. But really, it’s okay not to be okay. I continue to work on myself every day and know how lucky I am to have such a strong support system."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Denise Richards Would Return To RHOBH… On One Condition</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rbXSmmSroZ6jrrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16qbHRZpuarZedwaa%2B0mabnqSZoa6pecCnm2aZnZq5qq2MoZimpJmjfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tire-le-coyote-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-219979-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tire Le Coyote Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-green-shares-how-boyfriend-gaston-is-different-from-shep-rose.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Green Shares How Boyfriend Gaston Is Different From Shep Rose</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
