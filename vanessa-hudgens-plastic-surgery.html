That is the social environment in which we find ourselves. “However, if you look at old cultures, different cultures around the world, the ways in which we make ourselves feel a beautiful change,” Vanessa responded. “Some civilizations put huge plates in their lips, while others force bones up their noses, and right now, the way America defines beauty is often linked to plastic surgery.”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s a horrible thing,” she continued, “but I don’t believe it’s necessary for me at this time in my life.” She then went on to explain how she takes care of herself – mind, body, and spirit! “I’m like a 16-year-old yogi now.” So, self-reflection has always been important to me,” Vanessa explained. “I think it’s crucial for both your emotional and physical health, and it’s just really important to show yourself love and care,” she says.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Cardi B Admitted She Got Plastic Surgery: Before And After Surgery Photos</a></p><h2>Vanessa Hudgens Personal Life</h2><p>Hudgens dated her High School Melody co-star Zac Efron from 2005 to 2010.
