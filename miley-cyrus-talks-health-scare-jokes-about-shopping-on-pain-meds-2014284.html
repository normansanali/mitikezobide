"I was on this medicine for five days and everything was all good and on the sixth day, I just woke up … it was so scary … I had basically been poisoning myself with something I didn’t know I was really scary allergic to and it was so scary … I couldn't breath and my skin—everything—was going insane," Cyrus said.</p><p>The singer went on to admit that her hospital stay wasn't just scary—it was boring! “I was crying because I was so bored,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I’m laying here hooked to all these machines," she continued, "Every two hours, some woman comes in and pokes me with a needle, just miserable … I’m just laying here with nothing to do … My sister went and bought me a bunch of DVDs … Clueless and The Shining … I ended up doing way too much online shopping and whatever they had me one to make me not in pain, I made some very questionable choices on what I bought!"</p><p>One first for Cyrus that came out of the scary episode? "I went on my first ambulance ride,” she said, laughing, "That, I was excited about."</p><p>Now back in Los Angeles, with her next concert scheduled for May 2, Cyrus confirms, "I should be all good … it can happen for 5-27 days … so it can come back within those 27 days but I've been very good." So much so, the "Adore You" singer has added additional tour dates on her Bangerz tour to make up for those she missed while in the hospital.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyaxm6v2KusrGWklrmsv4yhnJqkpJ16tK%2FAq5xmop%2BgsrR5wJumrqxdqLWwvM%2BipaBln6N6sa3Ip2SmnZSoenN8kG1pcWxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bachelorette-promo-hannah-brown-ditches-her-crown.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Bachelorette Promo: Hannah Brown Ditches Her Crown</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-markle-celebrate-oscars-misan-harriman-nomination.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Markle celebrating Oscar's nominations following incredible recognition</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
