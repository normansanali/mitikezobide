When asked if WWE released her due to the content on her FanTime page, Rose admitted that she was never told that, but there is some confidentiality included in her release that she can’t talk about.</p><p>“Unfortunately, there is a confidentiality [agreement] and I can’t really discuss that. There was the one warning to take it down, and I complied,” Mandy Rose revealed. “There was no full nudity. I would never post anything that would harm my brand. Everything that I do, in the privacy of my own home, showing my fans behind-the-scenes action, whether it’s photo shoots, my everyday personal life, nothing is wrong with that. That’s what I was doing. You can’t believe everything you see on the internet, not everything is accurate. When I show photos me, sexy, like how I’ve been showing on my Instagram, which everyone can see, there is nothing wrong with that.”</p><p>When Tamron asked Mandy if she believed WWE targeted her, Rose said she didn’t think she was targeted but that everyone has their own opinion on what is and isn’t appropriate.</p><p>“I don’t really know, I don’t think I was targeted, I think it was just more, everyone has their own opinion,” Mandy Rose admitted. “I don’t see anything wrong with that photo [Rose wearing the NXT Women’s and NXT UK Women’s Titles and nothing else], as they didn’t either. Everyone has their own opinion on what they think is appropriate and what’s not.”</p><p>When asked if she was wronged by WWE, Rose said she couldn’t say she was wronged because she’s forever grateful for what WWE presented her with but said she’s still very hurt and disappointed.</p><p>“Because of everything that has happened since then, everything happens for a reason, and I can’t even say I was wronged because I’m so forever grateful for everything that the WWE has presented me with,” Mandy Rose said. “I can’t say I was wronged or not. I’m hurt. I’m very hurt. No one wants to get that call that you’re being fired from any job. I was very hurt and very disappointed.</p><p>“I was disappointed more because of everything I put into the business, but just the last year and a half; I was champion for 413 days, I unified the two titles, I was the third longest-reigning NXT Women’s Champion. I also created this must-see faction with two other women that I brought up. I got to see so many women develop their characters and they are younger than me and at the beginning of their careers.</p><p>“To me, that was so important because it was so rewarding for me. Losing the title was obviously a gut punch. I was so disappointed. At the end of the day, my purpose was gone. That’s where I felt lost and confused because of all the hard work. Driving home from that, a lot of things were going through my mind. You always think there are unanswered questions. At the end of the day, I love what I’ve done in WWE and I love the platform they presented me with. I am forever grateful for them.” [H/T: <a href=# rel=noopener>Fightful</a>]</p><p>Mandy Rose didn’t rule out a future return to WWE, citing the tried and true line of “never say never,” but did admit that a conversation would have to take place if the company wanted her to get rid of her FanTime account in order to return.</p><p>What do you make of Mandy Rose’s comments?
