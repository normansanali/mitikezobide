In the clip shared by E! on Thursday, March 18, Khloé admits to her sister Kim, 40, that she is a “high-risk” pregnancy carrier amid her ongoing IVF struggles with Tristan as they <a href=#>plan for baby no. 2.</a> Kim opens the discussion with a question: “What are the next steps with your eggs?”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tristan-thompson-net-worth.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tristan-thompson.png><p>“I have to wait until the mixing process is done before I know how many embryos I have,” Khloé responds. “But I spoke to Dr. A and she was just a little concerned about like, I did a check and blood panels and all this stuff, and she just said that I would be a high-risk carrier for a pregnancy.”</p><p>Without getting “into specifics” while filming, the reality star explained that her doctor “said that it’s, like, an 80-percent or something chance that I will miscarry.” She then revealed to Kim that she almost lost her daughter True when she was pregnant with her in 2018. “I almost miscarried with True, at the beginning,” Khloé confessed. “But I didn’t know that was, like, a lingering thing.”</p><p>The reality star later admits that her situation is “shocking” and “scary.” Speaking in a confessional, she says, “All I’m trying to do is bring more love into my life and into my family and it just seems to be running into more and more roadblocks and it’s really hard for me to digest.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>In early March, Khloé opened up about her IVF journey as she and Tristan plan to have another baby. “I actually have done IVF about three different times,” she shared on an episode of Sarah Hyland’s Lady Parts. “I froze my eggs once already and when I was ready to make embryos with Tristan, I was making embryos.”</p><p>Kim weighed in on Khloé’s situation, explaining that her experience with surrogacy was one of the “best” for her. The mother of four welcomed two of her <a href=#>children via surrogates</a>, and told her sister, “I think that you know what giving birth feels like. I always say, if you can do it, like, it’s such an amazing experience.’ But you’ll see that the love that you have for your kids is exactly the same.”</p><p>“There’s no difference,” she continued, “except for there was someone else that was the carrier.”</p><p>In another confessional, however, Khloé admits the process is still “daunting.” “I’m really grateful that there are other options, but I loved being pregnant with True, it’s such a beautiful experience to have,” she said. “Knowing I might not ever get to feel that way again—it’s daunting, it’s scary, it’s stressful and it breaks my heart,” Khloe admits.</p><p>Keeping Up With the Kardashians premieres Thursday, March 18 at 8:00pm ET/PT on E! and is available to stream on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hulu</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kHJvcm9pZLipuM6eZKSZopmutLTImqVmmZyivLTAjKagrJuRp7%2B6ecOarKCgpJq%2FbsDRrpxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mayfair-witches-cast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mayfair Witches AMC TV Series Cast and Story Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./karissa-rajpaul.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Karissa Rajpaul - Bio, Single, Facts, Net Worth, Career, Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
