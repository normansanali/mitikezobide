He showed me the recording process, and how to do my ad-libs. I just never forgot it. So that one studio session stuck with me.”</p><p>Growing up she looked up to singer Sade, musically. She also listened to a lot of R&B. She told the magazine, ” I was really into old school music because that’s all my mom played. I liked Mary J Blige. It’s crazy ’cause my music is totally opposite from her, but that’s who I like.”</p><p>Not long after, Stunna signed million dollar record deal with Capitol Music Group.
