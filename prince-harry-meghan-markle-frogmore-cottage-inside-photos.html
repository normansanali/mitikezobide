Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie also lived in the property when the couple moved to the US.</p><h2>Frogmore Cottage's kitchen</h2><p id=eyr2GLK4OP1 data-wc=30>In the couple's Netflix docuseries, a number of personal photographs were used, including a photograph of themselves inside the property's amazing <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>kitchen</a> </strong>in the teasing trailer, and we were blown away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/69aeca361948-frogmore-cottage-kitchen-z.jpg><p id=e4t8nikR0iIA data-wc=52>The photo allows fans to observe the sweet country-style kitchen almost in full, where the family have a massive marble-topped kitchen island with in-built cupboards and pendant lights hanging overhead. There are open shelves with hanging saucepans and cosy touches have been added to the cooking space including plants, flowers and artwork.</p><h2>Frogmore Cottage's bathroom</h2><p id=eA_QOog6uxIy data-wc=44>Another Netflix snippet gave an insight into bathtime with baby Archie when they were living at Frogmore.

Inside, it is reported that there are five bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room and a nursery, formerly for Archie.</p><p id=eapXaV1sZ1u0 data-wc=23>The property had a whole renovation in 2019 costing the Sovereign Grant a reported £2.4million, and the couple then repaid back the money.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a263cd6e4a00-prince-harry-meghan-markle-frogmore-house-lake-z-z.jpg><p id=eqBbayUXe0Jb data-wc=11><strong>Frogmore Cottage backs onto Home Park, with 655 acres of gardens</strong></p><p id=eIZrJh-KhWYu data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie's private playground will blow your mind</a></strong></p><h2>Frogmore Cottage's garden</h2><p id=e859nmQG7oXu data-wc=61>Outside, Meghan is also likely to have planted several of Archie's lemon-yellow&nbsp;namesake Chrysanthemums in the garden. Archie was granted the honorary flower as part of&nbsp;a tradition which dictates that royal family members&nbsp;receive a namesake variety of the flower, in a nod to the blooms that decorated Westminster Abbey on Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip's wedding day in 1947.</p><p id=e2KTvPvhfeWu data-wc=22>They also have a special tribute to one of their family members in the garden, in the form of a dog statue.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezewb4KPpGZ8 data-wc=5><strong>Baby August in the garden</strong></p><p id=ezz7r793OABa data-wc=51>Vicky's unique sense of style and what Meghan saw at the Soho House clubs may have also transferred into Frogmore Cottage. The clubs take design inspiration from the 1920s and 30s, with luxury furniture including velvet sofas and chandeliers, although Meghan and Harry will have of course made it their own.</p><p id=eArRGsIVETVJ data-wc=50>Vicky previously told Soho House, "Private homes are incredibly different. The clients come to us because they want the Soho House aesthetic but you have to make it right for that family or whoever lives there in their space, so it's not a cookie-cutter thing you can just drop in."</p><p id=ererdT1lj4rK data-wc=57>Both Harry and Meghan are also big art fans, with Harry having gifted Meghan a romantic canvas reading 'Everybody Needs Somebody to Love' by British artist Van Donna, during their courtship. The Queen is also believed to have given the couple a series of paintings from her own personal collection, which Eugenie and Jack can now enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXbsh8NdFDVJ data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJoaWlqY2WAcX6Qb2xwbWNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecyenqGZnmK6or7KpZxmnqKktK670Z5knKekqa6osYyipayhlJp6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./minions-based-on-true-story-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is 'Minions' Based on a True Story, as a TikTok Video Claims?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./husband-dave-lamar-and-singer-morissette-amon-age-gap-wedding-photos-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Husband Dave Lamar and Singer Morissette Amon Age Gap, Wedding Photos and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
