The Mormon Church distanced itself from plural marriage around 1890, but some Moron fundamentalists still practice polygamy today. By the late 1960s, Ervil — sometimes called the “Mormon Manson” — formed a fundamentalist sect unaffiliated with the mainstream Mormon church called the Church of the First Born of the Lamb of God.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Shortly after, the murders linked to LeBaron started, and members of the LeBaron family were often targeted. Those killings were just some of the many crimes connected to LeBaron and his followers.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-children-did-ervil-lebaron-have data-injectable=false>How many children did Ervil LeBaron have?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, Ervil LeBaron and his followers practiced polygamy in Mexico, and it’s believed that in his lifetime, <a href=#>LeBaron had at least 50 children and other stepchildren</a> with 13 wives. One of LeBaron’s kids, Anna LeBaron, escaped and wrote about her experience with the murderous fundamentalist leader in her book, The Polygamist’s Daughter: A Memoir. Anna also contributed to the 2024 Hulu series Daughters of the Cult.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Speaking with the <a href=#>BBC</a> the year her book came out, Anna said, “We were taught that we were celestial children, having been born from the prophet Ervil LeBaron. And we believed it. Even though we were treated so poorly we still believed we were celestial children.”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>According to Anna, Ervil told his family they were God’s chosen people, and that’s why they were persecuted. “That was how they used to explain all the moving in the middle of the night and staying ahead of the law,” Anna said.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How did Ervil LeBaron die?</h2><p data-characters=622 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>By the early 1980s, Ervil LeBaron was extradited to the U.S. and sentenced to life in prison for ordering the murder of Rulon C. Allred, another extremist, off-shoot Mormon sect leader. In 1981, however, LeBaron died by suicide while serving his sentence at age 56. He left behind orders for his family and followers to continue to murder in his name, including the now infamous “4 O’Clock Murders” in Texas in 1988. As many as 50 murders are linked to Ervil and his family, among other crimes such as bank robbery, drug and gun trafficking, and the rampant sexual and physical abuse of women and girls.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>Daughters of the Cult from ABC News Studios is a five-part <strong><a href=#>true crime</a></strong> documentary series about LeBaron, his family, and crimes expected Jan. 4, 2024, on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX528uHnMmqWyZZOdtq2w0Z6lZpyZmXqmvtWio2aklZeus7vNZp2rp51isaLBxqGrnqqjYrynedOhnGabpaHBbrTAr5xmmZ6Zeqm71mabopxdnbJusMieZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./howard-krein.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Howard Krein</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-jamie-foxx-change-his-name.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Jamie Foxx Really Changed His Name</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
