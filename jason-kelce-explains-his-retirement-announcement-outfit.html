Do I wear an Eagles shirt?’” Jason recalled. As he looked through his options, he decided on a black tank with “holes in it.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jason continued: “I’ve worn this shirt in practice. I’ve lifted weights in this shirt. This shirt was a part of this journey with me more than anything else in that closet.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jason-Kelce-Explains-His-Retirement-Announcement-Outfit-02.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jason teamed the top with sweatpants, his signature flip-flops and taped ankles courtesy of his longtime trainer <strong>Joe O’Pella</strong>. The taping was especially important for Jason as O’Pella has been battling cancer and was unable to tape him up before his final game on January 14 because he was in treatment. “He’s been there my entire career. … Thankfully he’s in remission, but he’s looking good. He taped my ankles for the press conference one last time, so I had ankle tape on and sandals,” Jason said on “New Heights.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>O’Pella <a href=#>opened up about his bond</a> with Jason via Instagram on Monday, sharing that Jason has impacted his life “in a way I never imagined.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“When I was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo radiation and chemo, he offered his shore house if I needed to get away, and offered to pay for meal services to help my wife and I out … I taped this guy’s ankles and thumbs every day for 13 season, and when he played his last game in Tampa, again I couldn’t be there due to cancer. When he told me he would be retiring, I expressed my regret of not being the last person to ever tape him, and he offered to have me tape him for his retirement press conference. That’s who he is,” O’Pella wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jason-Kelce-Explains-His-Retirement-Announcement-Outfit-01.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jason completed his Monday getup <a href=#>with a Rolex</a>. The timepiece was no ordinary accessory (not that a Rolex ever could be). The yellow gold Rolex GMT-Master II was a special team commission following the Eagles’ Super Bowl win in 2018. The watch features a green dial and a black ceramic bezel (a nod to the Eagles’ colors) — and it comes with a $50,000 price tag.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jason opened up about the watch and its significance last month during an appearance on the <a href=#>“Green Light With Chris Long”</a> podcast. “Super Bowl rings aren’t fun to wear,” he began. “First of all, you feel kind of like a douche, a little bit, I feel like, when you’re wearing it. It feels like you’re like, ‘Oh, look at me! I won a Super Bowl!’ And they’re also really big and clunky.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He added, “They’re not comfortable. So we all decided — along with a couple other guys on the team — let’s just have Rolexes made commemorating the Super Bowl.”</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>Jason’s retirement decision proved to be an emotional affair. In his speech, he spoke about his passion for the sport and his undying love for the only team he ever played on.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2ButLvNZqKepJOaeqbEz6WYoqajYrWqv4yrnK2hopq6prrTZpinpp%2Bqu6SxzJ6lrWWfqsGntdNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./movies-like-the-kill-team.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Liked The Kill Team?
