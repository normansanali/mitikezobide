In addition to being one of the faces at Victoria’s Secret, Nina has also appeared on numerous magazine covers, which has also improved her wealth.</p><h3>Nina Agdal Net Worth $300,000</h3><p>Nina Agdal grew up in Hillerød, and was interested in modelling from an early age, so she signed her first contract with the Elite Model Management. Soon after, Agdal appeared on the covers of such magazines as Bazar and Femina in Denmark, Esquire in Mexico, DT in Spain, and Bazar in Germany. After attracting interests elsewhere, Nina worked in ad campaigns for Body Central, Bebe Stores, Calzedonia, Billabong, Delia’s, Garage, Cover Style, Mimic, Nelly, and many others.</p><p>In 2012, Agdal moved a step upwards when she appeared in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, and was also named Rookie of the Year of the issue.

All these ventures contributed significantly to her net worth.</p><p>Nina also had a small cameo role in Doug Ellin’s comedy movie “Entourage” in 2015, starring <a href=#>Kevin Connolly</a>, <a href=#>Kevin Dillon</a>, <a href=#>Jeremy Piven</a>,<a href=#> Jerry Ferrara</a> and <a href=#>Adrian Grenier</a>.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Nina Agdal dated the American singer Joe Jonas in 2012, and the tabloids were all over the pair with increased rumours about their relationship.
