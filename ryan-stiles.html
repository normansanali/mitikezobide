Stiles played Carey’s erudite but underachieving best friend, Lewis Kiniski. In 1998, Carey successfully lobbied ABC to produce an American version of Whose Line Is It Anyway?</p><p>Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey credited as executive producers. Stiles received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show. A running gag of the show is Stiles’ flashy dress shoes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Though he never appeared in the series, Stiles performed in the taping of the unaired pilot episode of Drew Carey’s Green Screen Show, which involved improv games similar to Whose Line? games played in front of a massive green screen.

Please.”</p><p>In 2005, Stiles appeared in the mockumentary Conker: Celebrity Squirrel produced for the promotion of the Xbox video game Conker: Live & Reloaded.
