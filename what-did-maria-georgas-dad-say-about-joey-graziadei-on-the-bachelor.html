Given that she was a fan favorite, viewers took to X to express just how sad they are that she’s gone:</p><p>“MARIA U WILL BE MISSED #TheBachelor”</p><p>“Noooo Maria leaving is painful #TheBachelor”</p><p>“Noooo Maria😭😭😭😭 I’m shocked #TheBachelor”</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Traveling to Becker, Minnesota with Daisy, New Orleans, Louisiana with Kelsey, Rancho Cucamonga, California with Rachel, and Niagara Falls, Ontario with Maria, the latter consisted of Maria’s father — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the president of Jubilee Candy Corporation</a> — playing hardball with the Bachelor himself, but ultimately giving his blessing in the end.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>“So Joey, you have the most important thing in my life in your hands. She’s never brought anybody to me. The last thing I want to see is my kid get hurt,” Nick Georgas said upon Joey’s arrival.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>While the rest of the date was smooth sailing, Maria getting the boot at the end of the episode was unsurprising, to say the least, given the rather rocky journey that she and Joey have had on the show. We all remember when she had to go on an<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> “awkward as ever” two-on-one date</a> with Sydney Gordon, right? In case you missed it, or simply need a refresher, what did Maria’s dad have to say about Joey during her hometown date on The Bachelor?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maria Georgas (@maria.georgas)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Given that Maria is a self-proclaimed “Daddy’s Girl,” her father wants nothing but the best for his daughter, laying down the law with Joey during his appearance:</p><p>“I know you have feelings for my daughter, right? And I would hope so. If you see what I see in Maria, I understand why she’s here. You know, to me, she’s everything. She’s the greatest thing in the world. I don’t know if she’s mentioned to you about in the past and the accident that she had, and that was, for me, that was the worst day of my life. I almost lost her, and since then, we’ve been inseparable. To me, she’s my angel. She’s my princess.”</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>After chatting with Joey for a little while longer, Joey asked Maria’s dad for his daughter’s hand in marriage, should it get to that point at the end of the beloved competition series. Showing signs of hesitation, he eventually obliged, but given her untimely exit, it looks like this was not necessary after all:</p><p>“I mean, the way I see Maria tonight, I haven’t seen her that way with anybody, and I tell you that honestly. So, if she chooses you, then you choose her, because it’s both. It’s two-way street. So, if I know you’re the guy that she chose, I respect her decision. I would have no problems giving you my blessings… You become more to me than a son, because the woman that you chose is my life. Take care of her, respect her, and we’re gonna have a one big fat Greek-Italian wedding.”</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=false>While Maria is already greatly missed on our television screens, with three women remaining that are nothing short of sensational, who will steal Joey’s heart in the end, ultimately becoming his fiancée once and for all? To see for yourself — and to find out what the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unprecedented ending</a>” to season 28 is all about — tune into brand new episodes of The Bachelor every Monday on ABC, or stream them the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2hlGK6or7ImmSgnZ%2BntKK%2FjJ2YnWWjlsZurcGorK1lmqSyunnGq5izoZGZsqp5zqdkraCVYq%2Bir8eeo6iqXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-statler-from-90-day-fiances-real-name-inside-tlc-stars-tough-childhood.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Statler from 90 Day Fiancs real name?
