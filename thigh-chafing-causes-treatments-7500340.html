And, once you factor in sweaty thighs and summertime heat, it becomes a hard no.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But we have better things to do this summer than to be in pain because of thigh chafing — and so do you. Read ahead to learn from dermatologists about how to prevent thigh chafing, and the recommended methods and products they recommend to keep you comfortable all summer long.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-thigh-chafing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Thigh Chafing?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Thigh chafing refers to the irritation that results from skin on the inner thighs rubbing against each other,” says <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deanne Robinson</a>, MD, a dermatologist in Westport, CT. “The irritation often presents as red, blister-like lesions that might burn, sting or in general feel uncomfortable.” It’s quite common and can happen year-round, but it’s usually especially frequent during summer, when the increased heat and moisture from your sweat can exacerbate the irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That’s not to say that having thigh chafing implies that you’re overweight — since thigh chafing is just a by-product of the inner thighs experiencing friction. Your thighs could be chafed from wearing tight-fitting clothes that rub against your skin. Bottom line: Thigh chafing isn’t really indicative of how healthy or fit you are.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-side-effects-of-thigh-chafing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Side Effects of Thigh Chafing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In theory, thigh chafing isn’t harmful, though it may feel uncomfortable. However, “while thigh chafing is not particularly harmful or concerning, it can worsen with continued friction,” says New York City dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marisa Garshick</a>, MD. “Skin irritation can lead to discomfort, redness, pain, itching, infection, and scarring with discoloration.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, it can make day-to-day activities, like walking and jogging, very difficult due to the prolonged pain and discomfort, and can also cause the inner thighs to become especially sensitive to even the slightest pressure. If over-the-counter methods don’t provide any relief and chafing is left unchecked for a long period of time, the excessive friction on the thighs could cause the skin to be rubbed raw and could potentially cause the skin to open — and potentially bleed. In that case, our experts recommend seeing a board-certified dermatologist for help.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-treat-thigh-chafing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Treat Thigh Chafing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All of our experts recommend letting your skin rest by avoiding activities that could cause chafing. When bathing, make sure to use lukewarm water on your legs, avoid inflammation from hot water, and use a really gentle soap — that is, nothing heavily perfumed or stripping.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterwards, pat the skin dry with a clean towel, and apply your barrier-repair cream of choice before topping it off with a richer occlusive, such as Vaseline and Aquaphor, to seal the ingredients in. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joshua Zeichner</a>, MD, dermatologist and professor at Mount Sinai in New York City, is also a fan of Lano Original 101 Ointment Multipurpose Superbalm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For regular maintenance, consider body creams and lotions with ceramides and hyaluronic acid, such as Avene’s Cicalfate+ Restorative Cream. If your thighs are really inflamed, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rachel Nazarian</a>, MD, a dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology, also recommends applying an over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream to calm the skin down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-thigh-chafing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Thigh Chafing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ultimately, “the best way to prevent chafing it’s to make sure that your skin barrier is kept in top shape,” says Dr. Zeichner. “Make sure to moisturize the skin regularly, and apply an occlusive product over high risk areas. Ceramides also help repair the skin barrier.” He also recommends wearing loose fitted clothes that won’t rub your skin when you’re out and about to prevent chafing caused by fabric. Breathable fabrics are preferred, while moisture-wicking fabrics are also a great option for sweatier situations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are plenty of products that promise to stop thigh chafing, but finding a method that works for you might take a little trial and error. Both Dr. Garshick and Dr. Robinson recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Arm and Hammer Invisible Spray Powder</a> to absorb moisture and help keep skin dry. Another great option: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Megababe Thigh Rescue Stick</a>, which gives thighs a little slip to prevent excessive friction.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A wearable option (and my personal favorite) are the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Thigh Society Anti-Chafing Slip Shorts</a>. An incredibly lightweight and breathable base layer, these shorts physically prevent the skin of your thighs from ever actually making contact. Ultimately, while finding the right thigh-chafing prevention is a matter of personal preference, it’s worth going the extra mile to stop it before it starts.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706GgoKBdmLWissinnmabkarApr%2BMramemaSisq%2FA0mZubmhgaIFx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-monika-krzywkowska-actress-her-details-explored.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Monika Krzywkowska (Actress)?
