Since then, she has racked up 53 acting credits to her name.</p><p class=Fg>She is also a successful director, with 47 credits to her name, and producer, with 19 credits. Allen also has a deep love of dance, and even started the Debbie Allen Dance Academy, a non-profit organization that teaches a comprehensive dance curriculum to students.</p><p class=Fg>Allen herself is quite a talented dancer, a skill she decided to demonstrate on the 4th of July with an Instagram post in celebration of the American holiday.</p><p class=Fg>In the clip, Allen wore a tea-length flowing white skirt, a red shirt with a cape-like sleeve, and a pair of white sneakers.</p><p class=Fg>Allen danced around the small floor, showing off her skills to an enamored audience, as the band played the tune behind her.</p><p class=Fg>While the rest of the United States celebrated the day at home likely surrounded by friends and family, Allen was in Havana, Cuba at the time.</p><p class=Fg>The post already has close on 200,000 views, and over 50,000 likes.</p><p class=Fg>After her starring role in <i class=Eg>West Side Story</i>, Allen went on to appear in the movie <i class=Eg>Fame</i> as a dance instructor that same year. The movie was later adapted into a series spin-off, and Allen ended up winning 3 Emmy's for her choreography.</p><p class=Fg>While she opened her dance studio in 2001, she has continued to act, and is currently a series regular in the hit medical drama Grey's Anatomy, playing Dr Catherine Avery/Fox.</p><p class=Fg>Allen earned an honorary doctorate from the North Carolina School of the Arts, a school she had been rejected from as a teenager based on the color of her skin. It was not the only school she had been rejected from on the basis of race.</p><p class=Fg>When she was 12, Allen auditioned for the Houston Ballet School in Texas. Despite an excellent audition, the school denied her entry for being black. Later, a Russian instructor who had seen her dance enrolled her in the school in secret.</p><p class=Fg>By the time th administration realized what had been done, they were so impressed with her dancing that they allowed her to stay.</p><p class=Fg>Her rejection from the North Carolina School of the Arts was even more shocking, as during her audition she had actually been asked to demonstrate tenchniques to others auditioning.</p><p class=Fg>She was later told her "body was unsuited for ballet," something that, according to <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/people/debbie-allen-538186><i class=Eg>Biography.com</i></a>, was something often said to dancers of color to discourage them.</p><p class=Fg>During her career, Allen has also been given a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Women in Radio and Television.</p><p class=Fg>Allen is currently married to former NBA star Norm Nixon, with whom she has two children. She was previously married to Winnfred Wilford.</p><p class=Fg>Allen also credits a great deal of her success to her mother's example. When Allen was 10, her mother decided on a whim to move the family down to Mexico.</p><p class=Fg>"She didn't know anybody in Mexico," Allen recalled. "She didn't speak Spanish. She was looking for another level of experience...I respect that so much."</p><p class=Fg>Vivian Ayers Allen is now 95 years old, and her daughter took to her Instagram account with a special happy birthday message on the day.</p><p class=Fg>Allen's mother grinned a huge smile in the photo, wearing a loose-fitting white dress with lace inserts on the sleeves, and a colorful lei around her neck. She appeared to be enjoying a Hawaiian themed birthday party.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnJvaW9mYrGmrsGinGaZnKGyr3nSoaawq12Zrq%2BvxGaqpKGcocBuvsSdZK2noGO1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dictators-wives-who-died-awful-deaths.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dictators' Wives Who Died Awful Deaths</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./antonio-mill-n.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Antonio Milln</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
