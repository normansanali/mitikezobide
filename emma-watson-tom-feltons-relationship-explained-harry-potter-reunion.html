Watson played goody-two shoes, Hermione Granger and Felton played the bad boy Slytherin, Draco Malfoy, so they should have been mortal enemies, but Watson saw through the character and fell for the blonde-haired boy.</p><p>Throughout the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans have shipped Dramione-</a> on-screen and in real life. Some have even thought that she would get with either of the leading men- Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) or Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), but they were more like brothers to her.</p><p><a href=#>So, did Watson and Felton ever date</a> and did their feelings progress as they got older?

Felton played Draco- the bad, troubled boy from Slytherin, who did have some redeeming qualities in him. Despite Gryffindors and Slytherins being enemies, the two actually became friends on set. Although their characters didn't get that much screen time together, when they did, it was pure magic.</p><h2 id=tutoring-on-set-and-love-at-first-sight><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tutoring On Set And Love At First Sight</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the reunion special, Emma Watson recalled a time that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all of the kids had to go in for tutoring</a>. "I walked into the room where we were having tutoring. The assignment that had been given was to draw what you thought God looked like, and Tom had drawn a girl with a backward cap on a skateboard. And I just don’t know how to say it — I just fell in love with him. I used to come in every day and look for his number on the call sheet, it was number seven, and if his name was on the call sheet, it was an extra exciting day. He was three years above me and so for him he was like, ‘You’re like my little sister,'" she said.</p><h2 id=tom-felton-was-aware-of-emma-watson-39-s-feelings><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tom Felton Was Aware Of Emma Watson's Feelings</span></h2><p>Another thing fans will learn from the reunion special is that Felton was aware of Watson's feelings, and he automatically became protective over her. “I think I was in the hair and make-up chair, and someone said something along the lines of, ‘Yeah, she had a crush on you,' I became very protective over her. Yeah, I’ve always had a soft spot for her and that continues to this day. There’s always been something that’s like, I don’t know, a kinship," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Wizarding World Movie Made The Most At The Box Office, And How Much Will 'The Secrets Of Dumbledore' Make?</a></span></p><h2 id=birthday-tributes-and-social-media-posts><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Birthday Tributes And Social Media Posts</span></h2><p>Over the years, the former co-stars have been no strangers to posting about each other on social media, whether it was to wish the other a happy birthday, a casual hang out, or an accomplishment they are proud of. And naturally, fans would freak out. Just this past year, Felton posted a throwback birthday tribute to Watson with the caption, "Happy birthday to the one and only," which sent the internet into a frenzy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-felton-and-emma-watson-vacationing-together><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tom Felton And Emma Watson Vacationing Together</span></h2><p>Two summers ago, Watson and Felton went on a trip to South Africa together, where he taught her how to play the guitar. Now, friends vacation together, but this only fueled the dating rumors even more. During that time, they shared photo of themselves taken by the other person, according to their caption.

"There was always something. There was a little bit of a spark," he said, but he did want to start any rumors. He added, "But we were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance." So, if their co-stars saw it, why couldn't they?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Pics Are The Reason Fans Want Emma Watson & Tom Felton To End Up Together</a></span></p><h2 id=emma-watson-and-tom-felton-are-something-or-are-they><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Emma Watson And Tom Felton Are Something..

His response? "We are something, if that makes any sense, we've been very close for a long time. And I adore her, I think she's fantastic. Hopefully, she returns the compliment. But as far as the romantic side of it, I think that's a Slytherin-Gryffindor thing rather than a Tom and Emma thing."

They have been together since the fall of 2019 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have even sparked engagement rumors.</a> According to many sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Felton is currently single, </a>but did sign up for the dating app, Raya in 2020. So, maybe this small reunion sparked something in them or maybe it didn't, but we know for sure that the fans would be behind it every step of the way.
