Her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, started Party Pieces in 1987 after they reportedly couldn’t find the right coloured paper plates for Kate’s fifth birthday.</p><p>The Berkshire-based online company then expanded into party decor and gifts, said to be worth around A$56 million ($60m) at the height of its success.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But after the pandemic hit, Party Pieces recorded a loss of nearly A$540,000 in 2021. The Middletons expanded the company into the US last year, with branded shelves appearing in several chemists in New Jersey.</p><p>The family had reportedly hoped to avoid insolvency by selling the business and handing over cash to the buyer, but Sky News has reported that it was sold through a pre-pack administration process - meaning the sale had been organised before insolvency practitioners came into the picture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/WzQuEjUnJXmaSinH7Q8jqJ3qxTQ=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/ZEEOB7MZZ5AJ3HQLT3JZKC3RKY.jpg"><p>The sale reportedly did not include all of the company’s liabilities. At the time of the sale, the Middletons owned half of the company with the rest owned by investors.</p><p>The Daily Mail teased the upcoming sale last month, reporting that it was due to the family wanting to spend more time with their grandchildren, including Kate’s children George, Charlotte and Louis.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“Carole and Mike are ready to retire, and rather than just shut up shop, they are looking at the options to see whether someone will buy the business,” a family friend told the outlet.</p><p>“Carole has poured her heart and soul into Party Pieces and loves the business, but she’s 68 and is there running things pretty much fulltime every day.</p><p>“It’s too much of a commitment — she wants more time for family, gardening and travel.”</p><p>But it was also reported that Carole had been forced to ask suppliers to give the company a bigger window to pay bills following a “terrible Christmas”.</p><p>It’s thanks to Party Pieces’ one-time success that the Middletons’ children, including Kate, were able to go to exclusive British schools.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqSZpJp6rrXDnaOerJ%2BjwG6ywKagpbFdl8K0tc2eqqxlo6S5pXnApqCdZZOWwKl50q2prp%2BXobK0ecitqmasn6R6rsHCoWaMfWeNf5Khp32ReouCd5qSnriMbpF9hmebmns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pasta-fagioli.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pasta e Fagioli</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-lacob-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Lacob Net Worth Golden State Warriors Owner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
