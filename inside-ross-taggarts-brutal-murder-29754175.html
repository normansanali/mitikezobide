Taggart, 38, had initially told police that his mother had 'disappeared' after she stormed out of their home in Dunfermline following a heated row which sparked a missing person enquiry.</p><p>While police searched for Carol-Anne, the remorseless killer went on a spending spree with her credit card and even removed jewellery from her corpse which he pawned off for cash. Just hours after the murder, he also went to a woman's house who he met on an online dating website seeking sex.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article29754548.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_38742280-9210657-image-a-3_1612196110280.jpg><p>Taggart was later sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh to 18 years minimum in jail after police discovered the childminder's body wrapped in bedding and twine underneath a motorhome in Pettycur Bay in January 2015.</p><p>He is currently serving a life sentence in prison but still continues to taunt his heartbroken relatives from jail as the evil killer legally remains in charge of his mother's estate. In her will, Carol-Anne left her £500,000 fortune to her murderer son and made him the executor of her estate meaning he is in complete control of all the decisions made.</p><p>Although he can no longer profit from Carol-Anne's death due to his murder conviction, the monster refuses to resign as executor. The Netflix show will include an interview with Carol-Anne's daughter Lorraine Taggart Bristow, 34, who has been fighting to have the law changed so that murderers are unable to act as executor's of their victim's estate.</p><p>Lorraine previously told how her brother manipulated their mum and drove other family members away in order to take advantage of her trust.</p><p>It is believed Taggart killed Carol-Ann after she confronted him and tried to break free of his controlling behaviour. He had in fact killed his mum after an argument erupted at the mother-of-three's home. He repeatedly struck her, to the point where she lost consciousness.</p><p>Thinking Carol-Ann was dead, he dragged her body from her house to the caravan that she owned, where he strangled her and then hid her body under a neighbouring caravan. The next day, he drove his mother's car to the house of a woman he knew from a dating app, whom he met for sex. He later dumped the car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article29754638.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS54535247jpg-mi.jpg><p>'When Missing Turns to Murder' has been described as a 'powerful, forensic and highly emotional series that reveals what happens in a police investigation and to the family at its heart when a loved one goes missing and then they get the worst possible news.'</p><p>Miles Jarvis, founding partner at production firm Phoenix Television, who created the series for Netflix, said: "Viewer feedback from season one of When Missing Turns to Murder was hugely supportive of the families who take part.
