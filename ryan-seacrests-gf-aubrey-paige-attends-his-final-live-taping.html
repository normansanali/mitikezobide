The social media personality even blew a kiss to Seacrest before the episode went to a commercial.

He said, ‘Can I ask you a question? … She’s really tall. She’s taller than you, and much taller in heels. How does that work?’ I was like, ‘What are you asking me?’ He had that dead-serious look. He’s like, ‘Because Kelly and I talk about that all the time. The height.’”</p><p class=p1>Ripa, for her part, jokingly replied that she would “go into seclusion” if Seacrest and Paige ever broke up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ryan-Seacrests-Girlfriend-Aubrey-Paige-Supports-Him-During-Final-Live-Taping-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>The travel influencer has also been her beau’s biggest supporter since <a href=#>he announced his&nbsp;<i>Live&nbsp;</i>exit</a> earlier this year.</p><p class=p1>“Aubrey’s been a rock during the tougher times this past couple of years,” <a href=#>a second source told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in February</a> before noting that the reality TV producer has worked on his self-improvement. “Ryan has been very kind to himself recently. He regulates himself a lot better and doesn’t burn the candle at both ends. He still loves working, but he’s taking more time for himself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Following Seacrest’s&nbsp;<i>Live&nbsp;</i>departure, <a href=#>Consuelos will step into his shoes</a> full-time beginning on Monday, April 17.</p><p class=p1>“Mark and I owe everything we have in our professional lives to ABC,” Ripa, who shares three children with the&nbsp;<i>Kingdom&nbsp;</i>alum, <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us </i>in February of working alongside her husband</a>. “We met there at the beginning of our careers [on&nbsp;<i>All My&nbsp;</i>Children] and got married and had our kids while there. “So many wonderful moments have happened while with ABC, so it only makes sense for us to come full circle and work together once again for the show that has given us so much joy and so many years of memories.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmymZ5iwKatwqucrKyjYrSnecCumaudqWK9orXGnmSarKSau6W%2FjKGgrGWWnruiuIyloK%2BdXamusbXNoGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./samsung-galaxy-s10-may-firmware-update-improved-night-mode.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Samsung Galaxy S10 May Firmware Update: Improved Night Mode</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-vallori.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Vallori</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
