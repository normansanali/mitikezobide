The video&nbsp;depicts a conversation between herself and Tristan Thompson, about his relationship with Khloe. What was intended to be a snippet that generates interest&nbsp;in the upcoming episode has quickly turned into the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">public shaming of Tristan Thompson</a>, and it's clear that their hatred towards him runs deep.</p><h2 id=tristan-gets-trolled>Tristan Gets Trolled</h2><p>The video begins with Tristan Thompson and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> discussing how deeply affected Khloe is by what is said about her relationship with Tristan in the media. Fans have continued to generate negative <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commentary about his infidelities </a>and Thompson admits that they've had some 'really good days' and some are 'really bad.' Kim Kardashian is shocked that Khloe is letting this affect her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, this sneak peek video into this episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians has served as an even louder reminder of just how angry fans are with Tristan Thompson and&nbsp;gave fans another outlet to vent their hatred towards him.</p><p>Tristan Thompson was instantly trolled and the comments against his character traits came fast and furious.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tristan Thompson Dragged After Leaving A Flirty Comment On KhloÃ© Kardashian's Vid</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-lash-out>Fans Lash Out</h2><p>Fans didn't need to wait for that episode to air before lacing in to Tristan Thompson for all his wrongdoings.</p><p>The comments were harsh, and began with: "This guy is only with her for clout..." and "Khloe is a doormat ðŸ˜‚," quickly surfaced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The hatred continued with; "She knew what she was getting herself into when she got with him. Iâ€™m surprised she was able to keep him for this long," and "I think Khloe is just too desperate to have her baby daddy there with her and Tru. I can understand that but look at what the f**k he did!!!! That never goes away."</p><p>Things got more heated when one person vented by saying; "Every single word that came from his mouth, is lies," "He has done it twice before and heâ€™ll most likely do it again. Such a mess!," and "take some ownership for the way your actions have hurt and probably made her more insecure and embarrassed."</p><p>One person wrote; "itâ€™s f*&ked up that they can forgive this piece of s**t that was literally cheating on her while she was about to give birth," while another tried to&nbsp;directly to silence Tristan by saying; "Boyyy bye!!!
