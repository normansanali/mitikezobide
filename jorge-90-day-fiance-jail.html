Read on for more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Season 4 of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> introduced viewers to <a href=#>Jorge Nava</a>, a California native with a complicated personal history.</p><p>The star was arrested in February 2018 in Arizona for drug offenses. He reportedly spent two days in prison before getting released on a $25,000 bail. He received a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence in September 2018, but he was discharged early in May 2020. So, what exactly did Jorge do?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jorge Nava received a two and a half year prison sentence in September 2018.</h2><p><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> veteran <a href=#>Jorge Nava</a> was arrested in February 2018 in Arizona after the police found 293 pounds of high-grade marijuana in his car.</p><p>He was charged with possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and the intent to transport and/or sell marijuana. He received a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence in September 2018. Jorge reportedly pled guilty to drug trafficking before.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>"When I first started, with the charges against me, I was looking at around 24 years, something like that, some ridiculous number," Jorge told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. "But luckily, my lawyer was able to work out a plea agreement, and I got the charges dropped, and I ended up pleading to a class four felony in Arizona."</p><p>"I feel like it's really harsh of a penalty for the crime being. Just because it's marijuana-related and right now, it's going legal," Jorge said. "I feel like the whole fact of it, going to prison over the same stuff that’s legal is kinda crazy to me."</p><p>Intriguingly enough, Jorge and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anfisa Arkhipchenko</a>, his partner on <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a>, didn't break up immediately after his arrest. In fact, Jorge filed for divorce in August 2020, after around three years of marriage.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jorge Nava (@mrjnava_)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jorge Nava and his current girlfriend and baby mama, Rhoda Blua, started talking before his release from prison in 2020.</h2><p>The circumstances surrounding Jorge' and Anfisa's breakup are somewhat murky.</p><p>In an episode of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined</a>, Jorge reportedly remarked that Anfisa left him for good a few months after he went to prison. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, however, the stars might have stayed in touch until the summer of 2019. What's more, Jorge put down Nov. 19, 2019, as the date of their separation in the divorce papers. Jorge and his new girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhoda Blua</a>, reportedly started talking in 2020.</p><p>Jorge and Rhoda launched a family YouTube channel in April 2021, soon after their first daughter, Zara, was born. Rhoda shared a few details about how their love story began in a video titled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Our first video (Meet my family)</a>."</p><p>"When Jorge had barely been released there was a photo that was roaming around Instagram," Rhoda said. "It popped up on my newsfeed. It was the picture where he was in the all-orange suit or like the jumpsuit, and so I had seen ,and I was kind of like, 'Interested!'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>As Jorge explained, the photo was taken before his release, but it started going viral after he left prison.</p><p>"I looked him up, and then I realized that we had common interests, business-wise, and so, I messaged him, and I didn't think he was going to respond," she added. "I wasn't expecting him to respond. It started off super friendly."</p><p>They soon upgraded to FaceTime before doing in-person visits. Flash-forward to October 2021: Jorge and Rhoda recently announced that they are pregnant with their second baby.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yzs8RmcGlllJbGbrLImqWcnV2frqq4</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaya-stewart-net-worth-240250.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kaya Stewart Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffrey-brezovar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffrey Brezovar - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
