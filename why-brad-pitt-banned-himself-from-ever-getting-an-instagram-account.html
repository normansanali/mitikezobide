However, others like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio choose to remain traditional by keeping their identities off camera as quiet as possible.

The director detailed his memorable experience alongside the actor.</p><p>"He suggests an older-style movie star. He’s really good-looking. He’s also really masculine and he’s also really hip; he gets the joke.… But the thing that only the directors that work with Brad and the actors that act opposite him really know, what he’s so incredibly talented at, is his ability to really understand the scene."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tarantino continues, "He might not be able to articulate it, but he has an instinctive understanding about it. He’s one of the last remaining big-screen movie stars. It’s just a different breed of man.

Pitt revealed persistence if key, "you gotta keep plugging away," he said.</p><p>The interviewer would then change tone, telling Brad that he was the last movie star not to join Instagram. Pitt laughed off the question stating that he likes his privacy and that he's doing just fine without it, which is really hard to argue.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Aspiring Actors Mike And Matt Schlepp Spent $29,000 In An Effort To Transform Into Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p>Fans in the comment section of the video praised Pitt for his style, and choosing to keep private in this day and age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Brad Pitt doesn’t determine his self worth by how many likes he receives on Instagram unlike all the other desperate attention seekers wanting validation," the most liked comment writes.</p><p>Another fan writes, "I appreciate and like his old school mentality in this social media obsessed society of today."</p><p>Credit to Pitt for standing by his decision.

"He loves architecture, he loves creativity. He's living his best life under the circumstances."</p><p>As far as the key for Brad Pitt goes and his lifestyle, it is all about being real, even if that means you're different from everyone else. At the end of the day, it is about holding true to yourself.</p><p>"You can't be different for different's sake, and this doesn't always work, but you have to separate yourself from the normal read. Of course, it has to be truthful. If it's not truthful, don't waste your time," Pitt revealed.</p><p>Clearly, the actor thrived with this mentality and it appears as though he's doing just fine without social media. He likely won't ever join, but he did say you should never say never.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7%2BisIypoK2sXZeur7rEnWShoZ2osq2yjJ%2BpqKVdmsOmvoygnK2smaO0bq3NZqCnq6SWtLOtzGaYnJufqru1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-hall-obituary-nashville-tn-brian-hall-has-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Hall Obituary, Nashville TN, Brian Hall Has Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-keak-da-sneak.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What happened to Keak Da Sneak?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./burger-king-officially-debuts-meatless-impossible-whopper.html>Burger King Officially Debuts Meatless Impossible Whopper</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-spotted-at-countryside-mall.html>John Travolta and Kelly Preston spotted at Countryside Mall</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./josh-allen-reveals-if-buffalo-bills-have-taylor-swift-audible-call.html>Josh Allen Reveals If Buffalo Bills Have Taylor Swift Audible Call</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kenneth-david-pilon-charged-with-hate-crimes-against-blm.html>Kenneth David Pilon Charged with Hate Crimes Against BLM</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rilyn-dinyae.html>Rilyn Dinyae - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Single, Nationality, Facts</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxDash.
